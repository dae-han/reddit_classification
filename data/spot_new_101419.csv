Is mobile spotify virtually unsuable?,"For 1 year i stuck on the web/desktop version and can usually can do these things:

-start shuffle play at any songs

-the cringy ""we added"" list that literally ruins the mood of the playlist(i suspect this is like a shove-it-up-your-arse version of autoplay)

-only can hear previews of songs(instead of the, you know, **THE WHOLE SONG?**. Is this becoming shazam's song preview thing?)

"I used to look forward to Release Radar every week, now it's awful","For the past two years or so, I've discovered about 50% of my music through Release Radar. It was so incredibly spot-on.

It made my Friday evenings, I'd just put the thing on, do whatever and songs would just pierce my hearing and touch me.

Now, holy shit, it's awful. It keeps suggesting the same brand of music that I really don't listen to. Over, and over, and over again. I have no idea how it's remotely related to anything I listen to. No matter how much, week after week I say I don't like the songs, no matter how many songs I do add to my library that I fit with my tastes that I hope will influence Release Radar, it just keeps getting worse and worse.

For such a big corporation behind it and such a large number of downloads it's also absurdly buggy. I have turned off battery optimization but it still gets auto-killed constantly when it's in the background. 

For being one of my top 5 most used apps it's getting to the point where I'm considering paying more money for a different service just because the experience is so shitty with using Spotify.

This guy has only 2 offiicial albums and his page is a complete mess, full of official and unofficial mixtapes, bootlegs which are not even listed in Wikipedia or Discogs,  duplicate albums and even... ringtones albums ???

Bone Thugs is another good example with bootlegs, solo albums that should be in the solo artiste page, Bone Brothers albums that should be in... well Bone Brothers page, clean and explicit albums appears twice but no album has the explicit lyrics logo...

Wu-Tang ? 15 albums are listed and only half are really related to the band and the other half should be in the Compilation section below.

A lot of artists have all these useless or fake albums that should be listed elsewhere or even deleted, in order to make the experience more coherent and clearer. Snoop Dogg page used to be a mess and it",0,0,2.517902431954388,spotify

Spotify making changes without listening users,"I'm the only one tired of Spotify unnecessary changes?
In the last few months Spotify have been changing the app, mostly removing functions or replacing the existing ones. I understand they need to innovate their app and bring new futures but most of the changes are just unnecessary and pisses of users.

A few weeks ago they removed the Daily Mix playlists, that pissed almost everybody and then after the users start complain they bring it back but now they are limited Playlists and because that wasn't enough they changed the algorithm so all my 6 playlist sound almost the same which is so annoying because they picked up something that was already good and made it bad. Users keep complain about the changes but feels like they didn't care anymore.

Other change for example is the ""Also appears on"" menu, where it used to show singles and albums the artist was featured in, but they just removed it without an explanation. And the thing is the menu wasn't causing any problems on the app and many users used it, people keep complaining about the changes but Spotify does nothing, they just come to the forum with their pre-made text saying they appreciate your review and they are working on it, but they just don't care. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò§

I did this post because I wanted to know your opinions about that, not because a post on Reddit will change Spotify app but just wanted to talk about it.","['Yup, you‚Äôre the only one. No one in the history of this sub has ever complained about Spotify taking away features and becoming more user unfriendly over time. \n\nP.S. definitely don‚Äôt look at any of the past posts on this sub.', ""They do whatever they want,they don't give a crap about customers and listeners""]",4,2.5632612285183534,spotify

And then you are left with 10 new songs per week, and atleast half of these songs are crap, so you are left with potentially 5 good songs for the week.

The more you input you give them, the more accurate your DW will be.

So maybe that matters.', 'The thing is, you need to put a little effort into working WITH Discover Weekly in order to truly optimize it.

What are the best ways to discover music?,"I've been using spotify constantly for over a year now and decided to wipe my Liked Songs library which had over 2000 songs in it. Mainly because I've got tired of hearing the same songs that I've been listening for God knows how many years.

I've been a spotify user for maybe 4 years, but had a tendency to change accounts, as I've said current one has a memory and taste of around one year. 

My plan is just to go wherever spotify takes me and build the library from there. I understand that daily mixes will still be filled with songs that I've got rid of, but I don't mind adding some of them back.

Anyway... Any tips on discovering new music? Thanks.","['When I get bored to listen my playlists. I usually listen real radio.

Strange behavior suggesting hijacking Spotify,"To start off: I'm very secure savvy overall, I do not use Facebook - my email is 100% secure and my password are all randomly generated regardless of what platform I'm using.  I've been using Spotify for a while, but only recently upgraded to premium. Almost within a week my account started displaying strange behavior of quitting songs in the middle, pausing or playing random tracks I had never heard of. It started playing tracks from an account named ""stuart.piker"". I've no idea who this individual is, and seeing their username appears to be their name I'm quite convinced I've never even known this person.

Naturally I generated a new password, changed the old and tried again. Initially this was to no avail, Stuart would just take control again and play arbitrary songs. So I decided to research this issue, and it appears to be rather common and widespread with Spotify. I would deem the odds of someone having actually hijacked my account about zero, unless there has been a leak on Spotify's behalf. A few hours ago I discovered a button called ""private session"", which would, according to the Spotify manual, prevent it from sharing information with Facebook(not sure why this wouldn't be the default setting in first place). Upon enabling this I no longer experienced Stuart being a clown and going about listening to whatever he pleased. This has however only been a few hours, so perhaps Stuart himself is panicking with the same issue I'm experiencing on his end.

I don't want to throw about accusations, but I think there might be something very wrong with the Spotify service. This is the first time in any application ever anything similar to this happened to me.","[""I'd say you were hacked.  BTW no email is 100% secure.  Give the right person enough time and they can find a way in.\n\nIf you experience problems again I would suggest to first log out of all devices.  Then reset password.

Nothing worse than being excited by a surprise song release and then finding out it‚Äôs not even theirs. This seems to occur more and more frequently recently but that could just be my experience.","['This definitely happens, but not the way you probably imagine. Artists don\'t ""upload songs to a page"". Distributors send music to Spotify in bulk deliveries. Each release and track has metadata to say which artists are involved. Ideally this is done using unique artist IDs, not just names, in which case there is no problem. \n\nBut some distributors don\'t provide IDs, just names. In these cases there is code on the Spotify end that earnestly tries to figure out which artist by that name is meant. It usually works! But not always. \n\nThis is why, when these errors DO happen, they usually take the form of an independent artist\'s work getting credited to a more popular artist, rather than vice versa.\n\nWe (I work at Spotify, though not specifically on this) try to catch mis-assigned new releases before they appear, but there are 40k+ new releases on Spotify every week, so it\'s...challenging.']",8,6.241363094595296,spotify

PLEASE HELP How to sort lists of playlists on Chromebook or Phone,"Hey, so I'm pulling my hair out. I recently switched from Google Play Music to Spotify so that I can easily control all of my devices and stereo that's connected to an old laptop.  That way my phone or chromebook are my remote.

But I'm not finding the most simple and basic thing that I need. To sort my list of playlists alphabetically.  When Im trying to add new music to various playlists or play various playlists, it's needlessly frustrating.

In Google Play or Apple Music you press a couple buttons to do this.

On teh Googlez it sounds like if I had the Windows Application I could do this, but I only have my Chromebook, an outdated windows laptop (that Spotify wont install on because it's too old) and my S9.

Am I overlooking some simple button? Or is this real not even an option in spotify? I read through the 3rd party apps list, but didn't find one that accomplishes this simple task.

Bluetooth problems since Android 10,"Ever since I updated to Android 10 on my Pixel 3 I've had issues with playback over Bluetooth connection. Instead of dipping the volume down for a notification like it used to (although it hasn't done that since I got this phone) it pauses for a second.

A quick pause, a two second wait, and pushing play again *usually* solves the problem, but not always. Sometimes I have to force quit the app.
Notifications from Facebook and Lyft Driver apps nearly always do it, but Messenger and Android Messages almost never do. I have battery optimization off already, and I've cleared my cache and updated to the latest version. Amazon Music doesn't have this issue either.

What should I choose when applying for Playlist,"Hey, does anyone know this?I am about to apply for spotify editoral playlist. And it ask me to choose mood of my song.

And there is no such option - such classical or inspirational. But when I click on classical it shows me this options: baroque, choral, medieval etc.

Can anybody help me what to choose to have better chance to get there? Or should I click on ""none of these"" for three times?Thank you.",0,0,7.550830687717707,spotify

How about a notification of removed band/album/song Spotify?,"I appreciate the ‚Äúhey, a new song from your favorite artist is available‚Äù emails, but it would be fantastic if Spotify notified you when they removed an artist/album/song you had on a playlist or saved. For example, I spent an hour looking for a commonly played song on my personal 600+ song playlist and thought I was going crazy. I knew exactly where the song had been located on my playlist and vaguely recalled the song‚Äôs title, but I was not 100% certain.  You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd recall the artist, but it came from Discover Weekly not too long ago. Luckily, my friend was able to locate a photo I had sent back when I first heard the song and, sure enough, I had the song title correct, but the EP is no longer available (some songs from the artist are still available). The song was removed from my playlist without any notification. Perhaps if I was following the artist I may have received an update, as I have artist updates turned on? Regardless, it would be lovely to receive notifications informing subscribers that they need to seek an alternative music outlet to continue listening to a particular artist/album/song if they are no longer available via Spotify.","['You can enable ""show unplayable songs"" in the settings.

There is, however, one more deal as well which is for the whole family where you need to pay $14.99 for 6 accounts in the family. If you subscribe to their services annually then you will be charged $99 annually which is great of course. Going to the highlights of the Spotify premium, in the Spotify premium, you will get in excess of 40 million melodies and furthermore recently discharged tunes too.

By and large, Spotify doesn't give boundless mixes their premium apk yet be that as it may, with this apk, you can go for boundless mixes. The one more feature that is the charm of the Spotify apk is the extreme audio feature which is also been unlocked in the mod apk version of the Spotify.  The Spotify Connect feature is unlocked for the cc videos only and you will not get it unlocked for the cc audio.  To install the mod apk follow the steps given below.

It is a short, eclectic mix of songs that I really enjoy, and I've already started putting together a second and third playlist of similar variety.

This first playlist features artists ranging from Of Montreal and Glass Animals to Anderson .Paak and Saba. It includes like, half of Tame Impala's Currents album, which I included because A) it's awesome, and B) I knew the person I was making it for really enjoyed them; I was hoping it would be a mix of familiar and unfamiliar music that they could enjoy. Tame Impala and Of Montreal (who I just saw this past weekend) are the ""anchor"" of the playlist, they have a couple songs each while the other artists have one or two. It was made with the intention of BEING LISTENED TO IN ORDER. Enjoy it however you like but I recommend listening to it in order at least once.

The playlist is only an hour and a half long, whether you know it's the type of music you enjoy or you're just looking for something fun/new, give it a listen!

Help us love Spotify...gripes I can't seem to fix,"I made a big case to my family for switching to Spotify from YouTube (FOUR 10 minute ads in a row?!) and pandora (years of curated playlists pruned), and now there's egg on my face. As soon as we converted over 2 things started happening, and both are bad enough that we are back to using the others.

1) Constant log outs. This happens every time we switch to the app on all our phones (Android mostly), Xbox, and more rarely on the desktops (both pc and Apple). If we even switch apps for a moment and go back it's a forced log out. This is a major problem of you're, say, driving and can't stare at the phone. No other apps do this, only spotify refuses to stay logged in. I can't find any security settings that might be culprit, especially across platforms. 

2) Adding unwanted songs to our playlists and liked songs. I noticed this before but thought maybe I just overlooked them or something. But after dealing with the frustration of logging in for the fourth time in an hour today I realized it was again playing stuff I never, ever would have added. I looked at the list and it had 50 songs added to my liked songs that I had to manually go through and remove. Huge pain. I can't find anything in the settings to prevent Spotify from polluting my lists with whatever crap they're peddling. 

If anyone can help me sort these issues I'd be appreciative, because aside from this stuff I love it far more. Maybe there's a hidden setting somewhere? Do I need to sacrifice a koala while I let it play the entire list of mysteriously added songs? Whatever idc because no one seems to like koalas anyways.","[""I have had Spotify on and off for years and never have had my playlist or liked songs do this besides in one case when my account was hacked. It ruined my suggestions for almost a year. I literally deleted and restarted. \n\nI do know some people have thought their playlist had songs added but this was just the continue playing feature which plays songs similar to what's in that playlist once that playlist is done. \n\nAs for the log out I'm clueless""]",3,9.12088855870344,spotify

When I'm able to log back in someone has listened to some obscure album. 

Surely this isn't right. I don't know if this just bad luck, Spotify's fault, or my fault. I honestly just feel like blaming Spotify at this point.","[""Eh.\n\nI've had my spotify for like shit, I dunno, 5-6 years(?) now and never once had an issue.

HELP! Android App Doesn't Stay Signed In - Losing All Offline Music Every Time I open APP. Sick Of It.,"PREMIUM

UK

ANDROID 

My SD card became corrupt so I lost all of my offline music. Finally loaded 3000 songs for offline on to new SD card. Go to gym. It had signed me out. Managed to download one small playlist on the gyms crappy free wifi. Went up to gym. Signed out.

I have had nothing but issues with spotify for the last year. Even when my old SD card was working it would randomly delete all of my offline music for no reason. Once before a long flight with no wifi.

You only have to look around this forum to see how shoddy and problematic the app is. What do I do?

Don't insult me by asking me to do a clean install. I've done this more than I've changed underpants this week. It doesn't change anything. I'm sick of having to redownload 3000 songs, which takes a while, then the second I close the app I'm signed out and all music is removed from offline again. I'm one more wipe away from cancelling.

Any help appreciated but again, don't ask me to do a fresh install.

Spotify Quality of Life,"Can we get a ""quality of life"" update? I feel like there are so many little things that would make Spotify so much better.

I listen to podcasts in a separate app and don't want to see them in Spotify. This should be a simple thing that users can toggle on/off to suit their preferences. \n\n\\- Better library management.

Made a pretty concise Anthology of Punk Playlist for someone. Thought you all may appreciate it.,,"[""1. Stooges- This is Iggy Pop, grandfather of punk, and I like this song a lot.\n\n2. Ramones - Also grandfathers of punk, I'm sure you know them\n\n3. Clash - same story\n\n4. Sex Pistols - Same story.\xa0 They aren't very good IMHO, but iconic, and sid and nancy and all that.\n\n5. Sham 69- Lesser known than the previous.\xa0 British punk band, they were also sort of the start of Oi! which is a skinhead offshoot of punk.\xa0 Skinhead doesn't mean racist by the way. It was the style that came from the dock workers. Bob marley was a skinhead / rudeboy at one point.\n\n6. Cocksparrer - same story as above\n\n7. Buzzcocks - Same era, but more on the punk end.\xa0 Plus the song is hilarious.\n\n8. Cramps - Same era again, but they had more of a psychobilly flair as punk came into it's own and started splintering into different factions.\n\n**9. New York Dolls - I should have had them higher in the list for time, but another punk band, but they had more influence from glam rock.**\n\n10. Bad Brains - these guys were a huge deal, they were punk as fuck, started in 77, whereas 5-9 were all around 1974-1975.\xa0 They are american, and black dudes.\xa0 They were influenced by rastafarianism, and I think they were all vegans.\xa0 They were also kinda the godfathers of hardcore.\n\n11. Fear - Same era, punk with almost a country edge.\xa0\xa0\n\n12- Exploited - pure punk / gutter punk.\xa0 Shit music, but super popular.\n\n13. Subhumans - Pure punk / gutter punk, but much more intellectual and political.\n\n**14. Dead Kennedys - One of the best / most influential / most political punk bands ever.**\xa0\xa0\n\n15. DI - Super early 80s, hardcore punk.\xa0 Iconic, but maybe not great.\n\n**16- True sounds of liberty - TSOL - hardcore punk, but a grandfather of horror punk**\n\n**17. Black Flag - Super important band, Henry Rollins was the original frontman, he's a gem of a human.**\n\n18. Agent Orange - Another super wonderful band, and they actually had talent.\n\n19. Agnostic Front - Another early hardcore band. Very popular, very controversial.\n\n20. Misfits - THE horror punk band, everyone has their shirt. More melodic, Glenn Danzig also formed the metal band Danzig.\n\n21. Operation Ivy - The birth of skater / pop punk.\xa0 The members went on to form rancid.\n\n**22. Rancid - The first punk band that got a lot or radio play.**\n\n**23. Social Distortion - Super popular punk band with a country flair.\xa0 Mike ness is a big deal, just ask Steve.**\n\n24, Circle Jerks - another pure punk band that also helped form hardcore.\xa0 I like this song, it should have been earlier in the play list probably, this song was mid 80's\n\n**25. Descendants - Another of the first skater punk bands.\xa0 You've probably seen the shirts**\n\n**26. NoFX - super intelligent, irreverent, and political. Spanned decades, still touring.\xa0 Very much on the pop/skater end of punk.\xa0 Also, Fat Mike was in the movie Bad New Bears, which is funny.**\n\n27. The Vandals - Satirical skate punk band, lots of good stuff.\n\n28. Bad Religion - Older band, but continued success, and this was a later song of theirs.\xa0 Super duper smart people, and obviously a little anti-religion.\n\n**29. Dropkick Murphys- They are punk with some oi, and some hardcore, and a bit of boston/ irish flair.\xa0 Punk sorta turned into a San Francisco / Boston thing, and they are a boston band.\xa0 This was their first hit which was released on a hellcat records comp.\xa0 Mike McColgan left to become a firefighter, this was with him before Al Barr from the bruisers came in.**\n\n30. Pennywise - another super popular skate punk band\n\n**31. Bouncing souls - one of my favorite bands of all time, figure it was a good finish.**""]",1,10.089094577856638,spotify

I understand that this is not censorship or suppression as it only affects me personally. however I am intrigued that it hasnt been added to my top podcasts. 

anybody have any experience with this?",['It‚Äôs probably best you listen to anything other than Ben Shapiro üòÇ'],4,10.22909457799737,spotify

Given the success of my Power Ballad list, I decided to post the one I did showing the mellower side of pop music. Again, this a list based on personal preferences  (it couldn‚Äôt be different) and geographic circumstances (some songs that were a hit in my country may be unknown to you, while some worldwide hits wasn‚Äôt so huge here so inevitably there will be missing stuff, like I said), however I think I got most of bases covered with it.

Anyone else's Daily Mixes messed up with out-of-genre songs?,"I'm noticing my Daily Mixes are getting less-varied and the playlists themselves have songs that shouldn't be stuck in certain mixes.  For example, today I have 6 mixes:

* 4 ""Rock"" playlists that range from punk rock, punk rock with hard rock and ska, and 2 hard rock playlists
* 1 EDM
* 1 R&B/Rap/Hip Hop

Typically I have one hard rock, one punk rock, and maybe one ska.  The fourth usually is a throwaway with a weird mix of interests ranging from Flogging Molly to, yes, Weird Al.  I almost always have rap and EDM mixes.

Half of my mixes today are mostly normal. However, hard rock has PVRIS next to Falling In Reverse and Papa Roach.  The other hard rock has Hootie and the Blowfish next to Starset. The punk rock/ska playlist is billed as ""Blink-182, Rise Against, Sum 41, and more"" and is a weird mix of blink, Streetlight Manifesto, Alkaline Trio, Less Than Jake, and Sum 41 for example.

Two accounts on one iPhone?,"I just switched from Android to iPhone. I have a family plan and am using an extra account just for my Echo devices. On Android, I could duplicate the Spotify app and sign in to both from my personal and the Echo account in order to easily select radio stations or artists from the Echo account's app. 

Is there any way to get this same functionality in iOS? I don't want to sign out/in to the Echo account every time I want to use it, as I sync a lot of offline playlists. 

Any ideas are appreciated!",0,0,12.475437172093878,spotify

Why does the mobile version suck so hard compared to the tablet version???,"Used Spotify on my iPad for years to play music with no problems (apart from the excessive amount of advertising, but it's kinda expected if I'm not paying) but I recently sold it and decided to install the app on my phone... BIG effing mistake

now I can't play my playlists without Spotify shuffling my playlists and adding random songs that I don't even like to my existing playlists (that have previously remained unchanged for years) 

What is the point of this? And why is normal play mode now a ""premium feature"" when previously i could play whatever I wanted in what ever order I wanted to play it in at the cost of being forced to listen to ads, now I have to deal with ads AND random music that I didn't want in the first place 

YouTube Vanced is definitely looking like a fine alternative to this cancerous version of Spotify",0,0,12.875900135244484,spotify
