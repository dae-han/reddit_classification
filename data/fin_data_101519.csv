" Music will not play songs unless I add them to my music.I have several playlists that I listen to frequently. I often use the radio as well. Last night I went to search for a song that id heard on the TV and when I tapped it to play, nothing happened. I began picking random songs and I can't get anything to play. The now playing screen will pop up but after a few seconds it closes itself. 

Nothing is saved on my phone. I stream everything. But I can play any song that is in my music library. If I try to play a song not in my library, it will not play. Then I can add it to my library, and it plays. Curious, I checked my other devices. This same crazy thing happens on my  iPad, my  TV, and my mac. 

I've searched and searched and I can't find anything about this online. My subscription is current and I've never had problems previously. Does anyone ANYONE know wtf is going on? I've reset the phone. I've logged out of iTunes. Restored the firmware....Nothing. I'm getting pretty aggravated at this point. 

Thanks!",0,10,1256.0006030057618

"“You should have kept your CDs”Advice from Apple Music “Support” when trying to find out if they can get back my entire deleted music library when they cancelled my subscription when changing countries. Not once did the Apple Support person who did it say ‘oh by the way, if you change countries you will lose your entire library, here is a way to save it before we go ahead with it’. 

Anyone got any experience is getting back a music library? 

In short, converting your iTunes music library to Apple Music means you no longer own any of the music you’ve uploaded, even if it was from CDs from back in the day.

"so is the ""For You"" section the most stubborn thing in the world, or am I doing something wrong?I started using Apple Music about a week ago, and so far so good for the most part. Except for one thing. It seems like the ""For You"" tab is just ignoring my listening habits and continuing to recommend me really specific kinds of music that I'm really not looking for.

To elaborate, I listen to a lot of rap/r&b. They're my bread and butter when it comes to music. The issue is not only that the ""Hip-Hop"" and ""R&B"" sections of the ""For You"" tab seem to refuse to respond to my listening habits, it's that Apple Music seem hell bent on recommending me very specific types of artists. I'm getting obscure french rap from the mid 2000s, southern rap from the 2000s, and 90s R&B. I have no idea why. Nothing against those, really. It's just I've done nothing even close to warranting these kinds of suggestions.

I've been telling it to stop suggesting me just about every album that appears on my home page, multiple times a day. I've done it to dozens of albums at this point I'm sure. I've been adding albums that I do like to my library like crazy. I've been liking every track that I can, and adding them both to my library, and to playlists. No luck. Apple is CONVINCED that I need these oddly specific subsets of rap and R&B in my life. I know it's only been a week, but SURELY by this point whatever they use to generate music discovery should have figured out after being told for the 100th time that I'm just not interested in listening to Paul Wall.

Is it just one of those things that'll iron itself out over time? Am I bugged? Am I doing something wrong? pls help",0,9,24.227699690102426

"iTunes gone?Hey guys. I am, and always have been, an avid iTunes user. I have Apple Music as well, but I barely use it. WHY? Because a lot of the music I listen to is not offered. I’m very compulsive with my music. I have a system. I listen to a lot of artists and I like to go through their discographies chronologically. I like to listen to everything an artist has released.

I’ll use The Felice Brothers as an example. The Felice Brothers are a folk band from New York. They have a pretty extensive discography. I have bought, file shared, or torrented all their music. In my iTunes, I have all their albums organized by album and year. For bonus tracks and singles, I download the audio file off of YouTube and organize them into my iTunes in respect to the album they belong to or year of release. Apple Music has maybe five or six Felice Brothers albums and maybe one or two EPs. They’re lacking a lot of material. I understand that I will still be able to import my files into Apple Music, but will they be arranged the way I arrange them in my iTunes? This is one example of many artists whose music is scarce on Apple Music.

Now the syncing issue. When I listen to music, I like to keep track of my play count. Once I listen to an album five times, I’ll give it a rating. When my music is listened to on my iPod and then synced back to my iTunes, the play count updates accordingly. Will my play count transfer to my Apple Music library once iTunes is gone? Cause so far I see no option to see play count in Apple Music. Will I have my personal star ratings? Play count is very important to me. My music listening history lies there. I love to see how often I have listened to an album, I love keeping track of that, I love the organizational aspects of iTunes, my ratings, my album art, my playlists...

Before I update my Mac to Catalina, I need proof, evidence, hard confirmation that all of these things will still be there when I make the move. Otherwise I’m going to leave my system as it is.

"iPod (classic) shuffle Vs. iOS shuffle.TL;DR: started using my iPod classic again. It seems like the iPods shuffle- algorithm is better than iOS’s In my opinion. I get less back to back songs from the same artist/ same album on the iPods shuffle, than my iPhone’s. Since the launch of Apple Music, did Apple change the iOS shuffle algorithm? 



My Current library has 1902 songs. All from cds and direct downloads. No actual Apple Music streams. My iPhone and iPod has the same music library synced to them. 

Past few weeks I’ve been listening to my 6.5 gen iPod classic again. Either because the iPod is basically a single purpose device, unlike iOS devices. But It seems like I’m enjoying my music on shuffle more on my iPod, than I do on iPhone. 

We all have that song(s) that always come on with shuffle that we always skip, but on my iPod it seems like it happens less often than my iPhone. I always get the same ~250 songs I go though with slight variation to the mix on iOS. Like  on my iPod I’ve had times thinking “𝘥𝘢𝘮𝘯 𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘯’𝘵 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯 𝘮𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘩𝘴”. 

I  never just start same current shuffle queue when I listen to music. I always start a new shuffle queue at the beginning of a listening session. I know if I didn’t restart the queue on my iPhone then I wouldn’t notice this. But most of you know iOS doesn’t always remember the queue.

"iOs 13 Bugs Thread?I searched first, but didn’t see a dedicated thread for all the bugs we’ve been finding with the new iOs 13 update.

Music is definitely slower to react when tapping on a song, taking an extra second or two to actually start playing. This is true when using CarPlay, but the lag time is even worse there.

Another bug is that the Up Next music doesn’t go away after it is played through, so when the playlist of songs you have added to Up Next finishes and you click on another song, the “Do you want to clear Up Next?” alert will always pop up. This happens even when playing through an album. Up Next reactivates once the album is finished.

I’ve also noticed that playlists that don’t have dedicated art and instead have the generic 4-panel album art from the first tracks are all jumbled and don’t correspond to the actual playlists on the main scroll. When you click the playlist itself, the 4-panel on the inside shows correctly.

"iCloud didn’t delete all my music, I did by accident/purposeMy dad created his Apple ID account when we got our first MacBook(2012).  After years and turning into an adult of my own, I created my own Apple ID for the separate messages and photo sharing options but continued to use his for everything else. I even pay for the Apple Music family plan on his Apple ID. Using two Apple Ids had some bumps as expected but nothing that made me regret it so far.  My iCloud account actually holds all of his music and vice versa. 

Fast forward to a week ago, my dads contacts and mine have merged, where I have all of his now and Siri thinks he’s me. So my plan was to split our accounts accordingly. I was trying to find a way to get my music library (his account) on to my own iCloud account. I tried using my computer to make a playlist of my whole library, 1083 songs (almost 3 days worth of music), and then just share it with myself through text messages or through airdrop. After making the playlist, I deleted all the songs from my library and that’s when it also deleted every song from the playlist.... 

I tried to copy the music at first and then send it to myself through iMessage but it didn’t work and that’s when I thought of a playlist. I didn’t expect that by deleting my library it would also delete that music from my playlist??  I haven’t found many useful links at how to restore my library as most searches suggest logging into original Apple ID and turning on iCloud music library but I’m the one who deleted my own music instead.

Has anyone worked out the best way to do this?",0,1,23.603590893704034
"iCloud Music Library is a disasterSo far, the ONLY way I've been able to make Apple Music work without having the metadata for the songs in my iTunes library altered or deleted is to only use iCloud Music Library it on my Mac. 

iCloud Music Library seems determined to delete my loves and/or song ratings.  And iCML seems to always prioritize the info it has in the cloud over the info in my iTunes library even when my iTunes library is more current.  I change ratings in iTunes.  iCML deletes them.

I have three devices: A Mac, which is where I listen to music 95% of the time, plus an iPhone and an iPad.  The only way I've been able to use Apple Music without having my Mac's iTunes library garbled is to turn off iCML on my iPhone and my iPad.  For those, I sync files the old fashioned way - which means I can't sync Apple Music downloads to my iPhone or iPad... but each time I've tried turning on iCloud Music Library for more than one device, it has wreaked havoc on my library. Song ratings get deleted. Loves get deleted. Album ratings get added. Comments get deleted.
I think most people experience these problems but don't notice. I suspect I've experienced far more problems with iCML that I haven't noticed.

When I first started noticing changes being made to my library, I created a new smart playlist called CHECK RATINGS with two simple rules: Show all songs whose rating is greater than 0 stars and loved is false. Show all songs whose rating is 0 and loved is true. Then, I highlighted every song in my entire library rated 1 star or higher and I set them all to loved. I use applescripts triggered by hotkeys to rate songs (command+0 through command+5) so I altered the applescript to also love any song I'm rating 1 star or higher, and unlove any song I rate at 0 stars.

Once I set that up, it became easy to see if iCML was deleting either my ratings or my loves. I have no idea why, but to the best of my knowledge, it always seems to delete one but not the other (more often than not, it's the rating that gets deleted by iCML).

Once I set that up, something started to become obvious: if I'd use Apple's music app on my iPhone or iPad, iCloud Music Library would do wacky things to the iTunes library on my Mac EVEN IF I DIDN'T CHANGE ANY RATINGS OR LOVES ON MY iPHONE OR iPAD.

For example: I went a few months without using my iPad for listening to music. Yesterday, I became curious to see if iCML was turned on on my iPad. It was. I opened the music app, and sure enough, there was my whole library, being streamed by iCML. Afterward, when I connected my iPad to my Mac to charge it... ratings started being deleted from songs on my Mac. I clicked the CHECK RATINGS playlist and watched it happen. That playlist should be empty. Instead, it had 30 songs. Then 35, then 50+, then 100+... 200+... 500+... I think it eventually ended up being 1544 songs, all of whose ratings were deleted by iCloud Music Library... and all I did was open and glance through the music app on my iPad (I didn't even play anything!). So, I opened and then closed the music app on my iPad, and the next time I synced my iPad... chaos on my Mac's iTunes library.

iCloud Music Library is a disaster. I think most people haven't noticed because most people don't notice what's happening to their libraries.  And who can blame them?  It's not easy to keep track of changes to songs when you've got tens of thousands of them.

Apple Music needs the option to download music without using iCloud Music Library, even if that means not being able to sync Apple Music songs across devices.  Downloading music from Apple Music is the only reason I still have iCML turned on on my Mac.  It's off on my other devices, and if it keeps creating havoc, I'm going to have to turn it off on my Mac too.  At that point, there's no sense in paying $10 a month for Apple Music.

iHate iCloud Music Library.  It's a disaster.

Apple needs to treat a user's library as being sacred.  They should never change a user's ratings, loves or any other metadata without a user's consent **or intent.**",0,3,1189.1737511564709

"i don't use icloud music. i can add apple music songs to playlists but only from the playlist itself. it's.. infuriating.i often listen to 'for you' recommendations, new albums etc.  if i try to hit 'add to playlist' it tells me i need to have icloud music enabled.  i'm in no mood to risk my music collection across a bunch of hard drives by switching to icloud.  i just want to be able to add songs to a playlist, or even say 'i like this song, save it to a list of songs i like'.  this used to be possible on my original god damn ipod in the early 2000s.  but i can't do it on a paid service now.

i can do it by going to the playlist itself, then searching for the song in apple music, and adding it.  this is way more impractical and i'm not about to do it in the middle of a run or workday.

in older versions apparently this was possible:

Go to Settings > Music.

Turn off Add Playlist Songs.

but i don't have that option, there is no 'turn off playlist songs'.  is there any workaround for this?  i'm on the verge of cutting off my subscription and moving to spotify.  tried googling but nothing.

"[Question] Thinking about switching to Apple Music, but I'm having doubtsFor the past 4 years, I have been using Spotify Premium (but I have been using Spotify for almost 8 years now). The thing that I like about Spotify is the significant number of tracks that are available and the possibility of listening to pretty much any device. Also, podcasts.

However, the other day, I was trying to find an album that used to be available Spotify. It isn't anymore. Here on reddit someone said that the artist in question had all of his albums on apple music. So, I started reading about apple music and I'm now considering switching. My main questions are: How easy is to listen in devices that are not apple (this is mostly a problem in my workplace, since all of my other devices are apple)? Are there a lot of playlists made by users? Can you easily find not-well-known artists? People that moved from Spotify to Apple music, what do you like about Apple Music?

"[Possible Solution] Album's Artwork missing on Catalina Music AppItunes usually store all library files at 'User/Music/iTunes' path. So after Catalina, Apple had decided to transfer main directory to 'User/Music/Itunes/Itunes Media'. There you can find new folders like 'Automatically Add to Music'; 'Automatically Add to TV'.

I used to store my Itunes mp3 files on an external hard drive. So what I did was move Itunes Media directory to my external HD and delete file 'Music Library' at User/Music/Music (yes, its correct). After reopen Music app none of my albums where there.

At this moment I did change default directory in Music app settings, and point to that previous folder I had moved to my external HD. So the new path was '/Volumes/Music/iTunes Media' – After that I did move all my artists directores from older Itunes folder to '/Volumes/Music/Itunes Media/Automatically Add to Music'. I had to move four or five artists folders/directors per process, creating a queu and moving slowly possible, if you try to move tons of .mp3 at once Music app will add then but reembed doesn't work as spected and wouldn't process your files artwork. At least thats what happens to me. I've more than 13.000 album

After that Music app had start to add everything and move all files to '/Volumes/Music/Itunes Media/Music'.

"[Idea] A cheaper type of paid subscription, in which there still are ads, but you can choose your songs on mobile + some features (maybe offline tracks)Since the recent ""Spotify mod shutdown"", there's been a lot of talk on the issue.  

Essentially, Premium gives:  
- offline tracks  
- the ability to choose songs on mobile  
- no ads  

Meanwhile, the Spotify mod had:  
- the ability to choose songs on mobile  
- no ads  

I, as many users, am not that bothered by ads.  
I'd really like it if Spotify made 2 versions of paid subscriptions: Premium + a cheaper one (you choose the name).  
With the cheaper version they could give us some features and leave the ads.  

*I know that MANY of you on this sub are probably REALLY into music, so a 10€ / 10$ subscription may not be much for many of you for a service you use A LOT and for a hobby you really care about.  
But, for occasional music listeners and/or for people with A LOT of expenses (for medical reasons, family reasons, etc.) those 10$ per month can be a burden.  
And so these kinds of people ended up searching for ""alternative"" solutions like Spotify mod.*

- help Spotify increasing is paying customer base  
- help occasional music listeners contribute legally to the music industry**",1,6,578.5702856576277

You would think the one album named 21 that has sold around 31 million copies world wide, and is one of the best selling albums of all time, would somehow have made the short list of results.

In a practical sense, sometimes track titles are so asterisked out that I can't tell what they are saying. Also, it messes up all of my metadata with third party services like Last.FM.

Aside from that, It's just prudish and infantilizing. It's weird to censor song titles when the audio is not censored. And they're very aggressive with the censorship... even things like ""ass"" and ""damn"" are sometimes censored. My elementary school was less aggressive with censorship than Apple is...

"[Discussion] Introducing SongSync: My project to emulate Spotify Connect for Apple MusicHey everyone! I've heard a lot of complaints from people who switched from Spotify to Apple Music and miss the Connect feature. I'm one of those people and really miss it too, which is why I'm working on a new service called [SongSync](https://www.songsync.online/).

&#x200B;

**What is it?**

Basically Spotify Connect for Apple Music. It will let you view what's playing on your other devices, control playback of other devices, and transfer playback from device to device.

&#x200B;

**How does it work?**

I'm writing a suite of apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows that will run on your devices, talk to the SongSync server, and fetch song updates from the device that is currently playing. The app on the currently playing device sends the info for the currently playing song to the server for the other devices to view. If this is too vague, there's more in-depth info on the [demo page](https://www.songsync.online/demo.html).

&#x200B;

**If I use this, is my data safe?**

Yes! The point I want to get across most is that this service (plus the apps) collects absolutely no data other than what you explicitly give it. The extent of your stored data is: your SongSync username, password, currently playing song (plaintext info), and linked device names. You won't even need to provide an email address.

&#x200B;

**When will I be able to use it?**

It's still in the early stages, and progress is being made faster than I could have imagined. It's not ready to launch yet, but I plan on opening it up for beta testing in the future. I'm incredibly proud of the work I've done so far, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and get some community input. Let me know what you think, and what you'd want to see in a service like this!

&#x200B;

In the meantime, here are some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/M73Q5d8), and you can follow updates [here](https://www.songsync.online/updates.html).",0,7,29.491056172916736

So yeah, I tried Apple Music when it first came out but couldn't get used to it and didn't really like it compared to Spotify, so stayed with Spotify.

"[Discussion] I think the iOS 13 update made some simple functions worse. Let me explain why!Let's say you are listening to a new song and you want to add it to your library. Before the update you had a ""+"" button on the lower left corner and it couldn't get easier than that. Now on the lower left corner you have the ""lyrics"" button that I think is a way less useful than the ""add to library"" button. 

Worst thing is that on the opposite side you have another button but it is to see the queue, I suppose that button makes more sense but I find it annoying that when you pull down the ""queue"" button to hide it and continue browsing, after that, if you press the ""now playing"" song, it opens the ""queue"" again. 

Now the ""options"" button: In my opinion the button it is placed in a weird spot and the icon doesn't catch my attention enough to remember to touch it instead of the ""queue"" button. Everytime I want to add a song to my library I press the queue button because I forget that actions is at the ""..."" button.

Now, the last but not least of my complainings is: Why do they moved the ""Shuffle"" and ""Repeat"" buttons. I didn't notice how well they were implemented until they changed it. I know that before the update they were part of the queue too but you just had to pull up the queue to press ""Shuffle"" or ""Repeat"", now you have to touch two times on different parts of the screen to turn on or off those little icons.

What I think is a good idea but needs better implementation was the possibility to rearrange the actions in the options menu. I guess it was an opportunity from Apple to say: ""hey, these are the options, place them how you want so we are not responsible for ruining that too"".

I suppose Apple made those changes maybe to attract new users, but for someone really used to the functionality AM already had, this feel like a step-back. I hope they return to what they were well known for: good UI.

TL;DR: add to library button, shuffle and repeat are not easy to reach as they used to and the new queue is annoying.",0,2,8.107120982524423

My worry is that we're going to lose the ability to manage libraries as we currently can. Specifically, losing **Smart Playlists** and **the ability to edit** **tags** would be the worst to lose. In order to make things simple and clean, I can totally see how they'll get rid of these.

"Words cannot express the degree to which I despise Apple Music right now...After years of resistance I finally decided to sign up and give it a try a couple of weeks ago. It has taken a bit of time, but I’m learning my way around and figuring out Browse and For You and the other features. I was a bit irritated when it copied all of my playlists to all of my devices, some are situational, some are site specific, others are seasonal, some are activity based, and there are some that are just organizational; irritating but I can figure out a way to work around it. But who knows one day I might want to listen to Christmas music while doing housework at the beach on a stormy day....

But then.... I went to my computer.... a weird audio recording of a speech came up while on shuffle.... I needed to delete it.... and there right before my eyes.......

My *highly*curated library has been **RUINED**! Thousand upon thousands of tracks have had tags changed. Genre tags have been altered or completely stripped away, composers are gone or changed, titles have been changed (I like to put “X - Single [19xx] after appropriate songs or - CD/LP after albums if I had two copies from different sources.) It’s gone. Stripped away. Thousands upon thousands of tracks have been altered. Hundreds of hours work; destroyed. I have spent years fine tuning my library, I wasn’t done, I could never be done because there is always more music to be heard. Call me pedantic and anal if you wish but; Billie Jean - Single [1983] is Post-disco-funk not Pop, and Nirvana is Grunge not Alternative.

"Wife's music is dominating my For You/Radio stationA long while back, we shared an iTunes library. Everything was on one computer under my account and we sync'd iPods/iPhones to that computer. Then when Apple Music happened, we had a family plan. (Now we have individual plans through Verizon.) For quite some time, she listened to Apple Music on Apple TV, which was signed in as my account. We then got a HomePod and it's set up under her account.

My wife likes Country. I do not. Every week 1/2 or all of my Favorites Mix is her music. My personal radio station is generally better, but once in a while goes into Country mode.

* I cleared out my iTunes library and removed all of her music.
* I reset the play count on all tracks.
* I set the Homepod, Apple TV, and each of our iPhones to not share listening history.
* I've been unliking her music like crazy.
* I've been liking my music like crazy.
* I spent a month only listening to shuffle of my library of music.
* When I could, I set my Apple Music preferences for my music and did not include Country.

2-3 months later, I still can't get a decent playlist to come up. I feel like there's some secret data on me that I can't influence to counter years of country.

"Why is the free version of Spotify android such garbage ?I have no problems with the pc version and have been using it for more than a year now. I recently installed the mobile version and it's absolute dogshit.

Reasons:

- The next song in the playlist / album rarely plays by itself. Most of the time i have to unlock my phone and pause and unpause the song so the next one plays,

- You get only 6 skips per hour. Like what the hell ? Why is the free version of spotify on mobile such a downgrade from the pc version ?

- You can only listen to Albums, Non spotify playlists and your own playlists on shuffle. With the 6 skips per hour and the suffle mode it's so annoying when you listen to music and can't skip a song you don't like,

- They throw random songs in your playlist. When you finish a cycle of your playlist they start playing some random songs that are not even in my playlist. The reason i have a fucking playlist is so i can listen to a select few songs i really like. Not for spotify to show some hot garbage up my throat,

- The same is with artists albums. I recently found an artist i really like and wanted to listen to a specific album, but no. When i played it, the first song wasn't even from that album, and it's on shuffle so you can't even listen to the whole album. Why the hell do they mix some random songs from that artist in an album. 

What the hell is wrong with this app ?

And

2. It pretty much says ""Oh this is how you have your songs sorted? I'm going to make my list based on this sorting"", what I mean by that is, if you have your songs sorted A to Z it will play 99% songs starting with A, B, and C. If you have it sorted Z to A, 99% Z, Y, X, and W make up 99% of that shuffle. If you have it sorted New to Old 80% of the shuffle will be fairly recent. Old to new?

"Why Spotify is superior in comparison to Apple MusicMost of you probably already know how much Apple Music sucks atm, but here are my complaints from trying the 3 month trial (Iphone):

1. Apple Music lacks the on/off shuffle button function that spotify has. This creates an issue where you cant pick a song from a large playlist and have the playlist continue in order from there, or it just auto-shuffles. For this to happen, you need to click ""play"" at the top and SKIP EVERY SONG till you reach yours, and then it continues in order. Very infuriating for large playlists.
2. Apple Music lacks a playlist search function, so somehow if I want to play a specific song in a large playlist of say 500+ songs....I can't basically, it's impossible to find manually.
3. I could download my 700+ playlist and still have plenty of space on my 16gb iphone when I used spotify, with Apple Music it won't download over half of that. Why?

In conclusion, at this point in time Apple Music is useless when it comes to managing large playlists. It's many flaws and lack of simple features are ridiculous.",1,10,110.59196389037149

"Why I use Apple Music over SpotifySimply this: Spotify never works over my data plan. The gimmicks and UI are cool and all that, but it amounts to almost nothing when one app is too bloated to load music over data. Is that a knock on T-Mobile or Spotify? It doesn't matter, because the fact is that if Spotify can't take into account that MOST people have constricted data plans they're gonna keep losing customers to other streaming services.

I mean sure downloaded music is cool but not everybody has huge storage on their phones. Hell, I was using a cheap phone earlier this year IN 2018 that came with 4 gb of storage. You can bet the data wasn't fast either. These are the kinds of phones that developing markets are using, and when Spotify crams a bunch of features into your app that restrict me from simply LISTENING TO MY MUSIC then why bother using Spotify in the first place.

Sure, Apple Music may be streamlined, but at least Apple understands that not everybody NEEDS Genius live lyric displays or AI running behind every goddamn song at the expense of data connection.",0,1,330.9486817144575
"Why I like Apple Music more than SpotifyApple Music Library: Library, consisting of playlists, artists, albums, songs, downloaded, as well as my most recently added music. This is exactly what I want to see when opening music, and it’s what I use most often.

Spotify Library: That said most of these are similar in Spotify, but it’s not the main screen you see when opening the app. adding to the number of clicks between opening the app and playing my music is inherently inefficient.

Apple Music for you: Another amazing part of Apple Music that isn’t provided by Spotify. Has new music and recommended playlists that are pretty good. Then it shows me what my friends are listening to, which is by far the most useful. Then heavy rotation, Saturday albums, new releases, all things I want to see with music I want to hear.

Apple Music Browse: Same shit as Spotify, I literally never use it except for maybe sometimes listening to the playlists:

Spotify Browse: Podcasts, Charts, New Releases, Videos, Discover, Concerts, along with some of their recommended playlists and “Genres and Moods” so basically a whole bunch of options that I’m never going to click because it’s not MY MUSIC. Instead most of the time when I’m on this page it’s to find my library instead.

Radio: who the fuck listens to radio? I certainly don’t.

Apple Music Search: clean, simple, shows recent searches and trending searches. Big plus: can search for songs you don’t know the name to by searching up lyrics.

Spotify Search: no trending searches, and a big fucking white microphone on screen to speak to Spotify. And has these useless things called Spotify codes u can take a picture of.

Then listening to music: Apple Music: Easily go to album or artist that the song is playing from by touching where it’s displayed. Scroll down to see shuffle repeat settings. Lyrics can be shown or hidden, but best of all the default screen doesn’t show any of this, only when u scroll down. Downloading and adding to library is easy, organizing your up next is easy.

Spotify: all the settings are crammed into the three dots at the right. Shuffle and repeat are well placed, but this “queue” is the hardest thing to organize while listening to music on the phone. Also the atrocity that are lyrics. I don’t care about “behind the lyrics” all I want to see is are the lyrics themselves.

"Why I am not going to pay for spotify anymore:When I first heard about spotify, I was instantly intrigued. All my music can go everywhere with me for less than $10 a month. Can't beat it. 

So I tried out of the free trial, and I loved it. I knew after a day of using the paid service I wanted to keep paying. This was literally the greatest thing to happen to music since the electric guitar. 

So I let my trial period expire and got ready to buy, but for a day or so, I had ads because, like I said, my trial period ran out. 

Dat ads tho. 

Spotify has the BEST ads ever. They have ads that bring new upcoming artists to the spotlight, ads that let you know about release dates for records, etc. 

I want to pay for the service because the service is amazing, but I want to be able to hear the ads when I want. So I email the support team at spotify and pose the question ""can we premium users have a way to enable ads if we so choose?""

""We currently do not have that feature,"" was all the response I got. 

Meh, whatever. I'll just pay for it anyway. And I did. I paid for it for over a year. 

With the whole target holiday fiasco, the wife's and my debit cards were changed out, and the auto pay for spotify was gone and our premium ran out before I realized I had to change it over. So yesterday, I'm listening and I realize I have ads again....... and then it happened. 

I heard an ad for gamefly where spotify ""CUSTOMERS"" get 6 months free. 

A customer implies that person has paid for a service, yet all the paid members of spotify are left out of that deal because we don't hear the ads!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?

So now, until I get a way to enable ads, I am going to use the free service because I can still get all my music wherever I want, at any time.

"Where exactly is Apple Music not worse than Spotify?I started my AM trial a few weeks ago and so far it's the worst streaming service I've ever used. I switched from Spotify because of a bug that causes high data usage for already-downloaded tracks and so far that's the only thing where AM was better at. So far I've got this list:

- tracks take a while to start playing
>Spotify plays them instantly

- recommendations are the worst: I listen to Neurofunk DnB and it throws cheap Dubstep at me. I listen to Future house and based on that it recommends me some Justin Bieber remixes. I listen to trap (the ""real"" one before some shitty rappers kidnapped the term) and it thinks I will probably like some whiny autotune pop-rap.
>Spotify somehow knows how to separate genres, puts 5 great, 5 good and 20 bad tracks into my Discover Weekly

- apart from the absolutely abhorrent recommended ""My New Music Mix"", the only way to discover more songs is to play some handcrafted playlists that hardly match the music I am listening to. (or albums which are just as bad). Obviously a hand-picked selection can't satisfy everyone's needs but why not automate it?
>Spotify doesn't have GREAT algorithms that deliver individual playlists but at least their algorithms are GOOD enough

- stations often just don't start 
>Spotify at least tells you that the track hasn't been played often enough to deliver recommendations

- music stops when it stops
>What? When the playlist ends, Spotify just goes ahead playing similar music (that is actually similar) so, again, some really good recommendations.

- no public user playlists
>Spotify offers you to make your playlist public which is a great way for labels to get their music popular. Apple already buried one social network, now they are trying to connect users with artists instead of connecting users with other users which makes much more sense.


Now I am wondering why anyone would prefer Apple Music over Spotify. Are you actually more happy with it? The only advantages I've seen so far is that it doesn't use mobile data when you tell it not to do and one day I got a really good oldschool hip hop playlist but this was like 2 weeks ago, haven't had a good one since.

Apple releases more and more broken stuff but AM really shows where this company is going and I can't believe Tim Cook allows this to happen, Steve probably would've eliminated the whole development team for f*cking up so bad.

I've googled this issue and am only seeing references to check to see if my icloud music is turned on.  However, in iOS 13, there is no icloud for music anymore that I could find.

"What's your workflow for adding albums to listen to offline?Hello everyone,

This new update is making me feel a bit technology illiterate, so I wanted to see how other people are using the app now. Before the big change to how libraries work, if I wanted to listen to an album, I would just 'Save' it. This would put all of the songs into my saved songs list, which I would download for offline listening. Very simple, straightforward.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what to do, so I wanted to ask you all about your new workflow for saving albums to listen to offline. When I click 'save' on an album now, it shows up in my 'albums' list, but there doesn't seem to be a way to save it offline without manually going to every album and saving it offline (which is annoying, because as of recently the app has been *painfully* unresponsive for me).

Today Spotify changed the theme green to a different shade and people are vocalizing their rage here and it's pathetic. Why the hell do we have to be so offended by that?

There are plenty of other things to talk about on r/spotify but I don't think I'll be subscribing unless this becomes a little less like plenty of the other subreddits out there that are full of empty complaints about trivial things.

&#x200B;

1. Create a smart playlist in iTunes w/ a rule to say ""iCloud Status - is - No Longer Available.""
2. Look up those songs in Apple Music, and if they are there w/ the + ""add"" symbol, and blue color is not faded / at full color, they are available.
3. Go back to the song in your library and delete it, then go back to the song in Apple Music and add it back.

To Spotify: why do this now? The free service has been around for ages and this was never done before? This just further deters me from liking the song, rather than liking it. Plus, there wasn't even a button to add it to the playlist.

"What stops me from using “Music” and how I got iTunes back on CatalinaSo, originally I was pretty hyped for the new Music application, hoping stuff like “for you” and “browse” would finally be more responsive.     But, since it’s a web based interface, they weren’t....       Also the Album-View just sucks. I don’t want a whole new window to open when I click on an album.   They way it folded down in iTunes was perfect. I could open and album and browse for other albums on the same page. The new interface just seems clumsy to me.
But the biggest drawback for me certainly is the lack of any remote control function.   The classic iTunes remote app doesn’t work with “Music”.     So I tried to get my old iTunes back.     I still hat the app laying around in my TimeMachine.  But just copying the app gives you an error.    So I found I script online which allows me to “reinstall” the iTunes i had already copied.   iTunes works like a charm (syncing, library, remote) the only buggy thing is that it prevents finder from accessing your iDevices (so you have to sync via iTunes) and when opening the app it always asks for permission for inbound network activity (guess it’s for the remote)

I found the install script on this page (just copy it in the “script” application and run it)

"What is going on?I just got Spotify (and Spotify family premium) a month/two ago, made a playlist, downloaded it, and then made a separate playlist for a certain artist I liked. That’s it, occasionally adding new songs to my main playlist. 

One day, a bunch of edm playlists from this random edm label (I’m guessing) popped up in my recently played. Weird, but I’m not gonna go too crazy, those are probably a family members liked playlists (didn’t know how family premium worked yet). 

After that, those same playlists appeared in my liked playlists. I removed those. After, two artists started popping up in my liked and recently played. Removed all that, and this sorta keeps continuing for different small artists/label-made playlists.

But shit started getting odd when I was listening to my main playlist during class, and my songs literally stopped and started playing music from a rap label-made playlist (I think it was a label, the name of the playlist was EMG’s Favorite Hits or something close to that). I thought I was tripping, so I went to go shuffle my main playlist again. It worked for 50 seconds, and then another song from the same playlist paused my song to start playing. This happened again and again until I gave up on Spotify (during that class).

But what really set me off was when Spotify auto-generated a playlist called “My favs” (never had a playlist in my life that I named “My favs”) and it said that I created the playlist. It had two songs, one song from someone I don’t listen to, and one song from someone I don’t listen to or even know. I was creeped out by this, causing me to post here.

"What are the prospects for us Windows users?The title is a question, but it is gonna be more like sharing an opinion.

I'm currently on a free trial and I feel a little confused. I don't own anything from apple; my only music playing device is a Windows 8.1 laptop, and iTunes runs on it like Civilization V on Pentium IV - slow, laggy, jerky and this all not mentioning bugs and constant memory leaks. Plus - the UI is all messy and unintuitive. The web version doesn't help the picture either: it's surprisingly slow in both Firefox and Chrome and lacks many features. Yes, it's in Beta, things are changing and all that, but seeing all the posts here about dark theme already implemented in Safari and other stuff makes me think that web player is still somewhere at the bottom of their priority list. And these are all technical questions, but their legal practices look strange to me too. See, the country where I live has some obscure laws concerning obscenity: it does prohibit use of it in media, but how does streaming music relate to it is not clear. Yet they seem to have chosen the laziest approach by making explicit songs simply unavailable, or available only in clean versions. Meanwhile Deezer, for example, does just fine without hiding all explicit songs, and so do other services. 

Summing it all up, I'd say that I feel like an uninvited guest at someone else's party. And it's sad, because I kinda like this party: the music quality is good (AAC clearly surpasses MP3 and Ogg Vorbis used by other services), the catalog is decent, having some things that are unavailable on other platforms, and gapless playback is a pleasant feature (only thing that's good in iTunes, I'd say). And it makes me wonder if they really are going to become more open for other platforms and how long is it going to take them, because judging by how things are now, I may very well leave the service by the time my trial ends.",0,8,22.31934320827601
"What are the best ‘non-music’ or audio oddities you’ve found on AM?Obviously, most people use Apple Music to access its vast collection of songs and music albums.

However, if you play around with the search function, you can dig up some pretty intriguing recordings that might not necessarily be classified as music or songs. 

Off the top of my head, here’s some random interesting stuff I’ve come across:

- hypnosis scripts

- tinnitus solutions

- language learning courses

- white noise albums

- loads of random nature sounds

- binaural beats for study/sleep

- guided meditation recordings

"What are the best ways to discover music?I've been using spotify constantly for over a year now and decided to wipe my Liked Songs library which had over 2000 songs in it. Mainly because I've got tired of hearing the same songs that I've been listening for God knows how many years. And some songs were there just because I liked them back in the day but nowadays don't really click. 

I've been a spotify user for maybe 4 years, but had a tendency to change accounts, as I've said current one has a memory and taste of around one year. 

My plan is just to go wherever spotify takes me and build the library from there. I understand that daily mixes will still be filled with songs that I've got rid of, but I don't mind adding some of them back.

"What an absolutely terrible business decision. This needs to be said.Removed my original rant because, while I still generally disagree with what happened, I no longer believe it was anything intentional.

Basically my long time premium account, always paid for directly through Spotify @ the 9.99 price, had a auto-payment fail due to me getting a new debit card.

In this period between failed payment and updating of my payment method, Spotify cancelled my subscription. When I reactivated it, since I did it through the iOS App, my account was converted to a 12.99 subscription handled by Apple.


This caused confusion because I have had failed auto-payments before and updated my payment method in iOS app, yet maintained my 9.99 sub. The difference this time was that they deactivated my account.


I previously thought Apple took over the failed payment notifications for existing Spotify users in an attempt to get them to convert them into a higher price point @ 12.99, but I was wrong.

I do still feel that after being a paying member for years, a failed payment should just put my account on hold until I get around to putting in my updated number, then obviously should be returned to my previous subscription price. I understand that this may be an honest mistake and I'm sure Spotify will convert me back to the old subscription after cancelling my iOS sub.

"Went from Premium to Family Premium - lost all of my musicHi everyone. I've been Premium for a year and just found out about Family Premium so I added my boyfriend last night.

Since then, I have been unable to access my music. I've been on support chat for about two hours now with no success either. I am a subway commuter, so I download albums or playlists on spotify so that I can still listen on my commute. This morning, I couldn't play any of my downloaded music because it showed me no downloaded music! Anything I had listed as music was just ""regular"", no green downloaded icon beside it like usual. I wondered if it was maybe an error so I clicked on it, but it just said Spotify was offline and couldn't play that song at the time.

On my way home, I tried it again. It did the same thing. All of my music I had downloaded was un-downloaded. I couldn't play it. Still got the Spotify offline message. I don't understand. I know spotify is offline - that's why I downloaded the music!

Once I got above ground I tried, and when I opened it just said that something had gone wrong. Again on my computer as well. No music will play. Everything is there, I just can't actually access it.

I've been online with a Spotify support person for two hours now. I've tried multiple test accounts and it's still not working for me. I'm so annoyed and frustrated. She told me that basically my options are now to just individually create playlists of my own by individual song and download them, but I can't even search a song! She said that's basically it, that it doesn't look like I'm getting my music back. I can see my albums I have downloaded, but if I click on it, I get a black screen.

Is there anything I can do? Has this happened to anyone? I'm so rattled. Why did this happen as soon as I switched to Family? Could it really be that? Does anyone know...anything? Lol? At this point if I can't get my music back I'm going to cancel my subscription all together because I'm so annoyed, I can't believe this happened AND that after two hours of troubleshooting it still can't be fixed.

"Was this thing beta tested?If yes, how the hell did this many atrocious bugs, not to mention awful design choices, make it through? I'm reading horror stories about peoples' entire local libraries being hashed to pieces by Apple Music trying to match them to stuff in its collection. iTunes 12.2 has inexplicably and irreversibly lost its ability to push library changes to the cloud (and thus to my phone) and now completely reverts changes I make (ratings, playlists, etc.) seconds after I make them. Random songs are greyed out and unplayable because iTunes thinks I didn't buy them even though I just added them half an hour ago. Tagging a whole playlist or album for offline listening doesn't mark the individual songs themselves as available. It takes 3 taps to remove a single song, and there's no way to remove in bulk. (...) menus give different options for the same item depending on which screen you're on (search results vs. album for instance). *The list goes on.*

If not, *why the flying %$!@ not???* This is by far the buggiest release of any software that I have ever witnessed. It feels like they didn't even do an in-house bug testing. If they can beta test the entirety of iOS 9, why can't they beta test Apple Music?

"Warning: If you plan to move country in the future, you will lose all of your saved musicI was stoked when Apple Music was announced, as I already had a sizeable iTunes library that I didn't want to try and migrate to Spotify. Although it was a little weird and buggy at times, I pushed through the 3-month trial and decided it was worth paying for. 

During the trial I moved country and decided I wanted to use my new credit card from my new country since that was where I was getting paid. It turns out to use a credit card from a different country you need to change your iTunes account to that country. After switching I saw that all of the songs from Apple Music that I had added to ""My Music"" were gone my account!

I contacted Apple support and after a few hours and various levels of advisors they came back with this

http://i.imgur.com/aOsS6pL.png

Turns out if you move country you're basically expected to write down everything you had saved from Apple Music and then go and re-add it yourself. They wont even try to match things that were available in your old country to your new account. You have to start from scratch!

I was hoping so bad for Apple Music to work but this blatant disregard for customers music collection is something I can't deal with. Am trying out Spotify but will most likely go with Google Music since it will let me upload songs that aren't available like Apple Music does, and seems to have better resilience when changing country.",0,5,1471.4420497670606

"WHAT THE FUCK! MY SPOTIFY ACCUONT WAS LEAKEDToday morning I woke up to an email saying my email address was successfully changed, and I no longer have access to spotify. 

Why the fuck is this even an option in spotify??!?!?

I reverse searched my email and it pulled up with some french fucking site of over 400+ leaked accounts and their passwords on some fucking forum. 

I'm furious beyond measure right now. ~~How the fuck did spotify information get leaked? What kind of fucking potato servers do they have???~~

___

**Edit:** I'd like to clear some up some stuff as I was pretty pissed when I posted this. My password was unique to spotify. I personally thought it was pretty secure since it was in two different languages and had special characters. However, it was a short password. 

Account is using my email which I only use for subscripton services and personal emailing. It shouldn't have been exposed to anything shady. 

I was hacked by a french hacking group, which even on their website they have a guide you can purchase which shows a detailed way of how you can specifically hack spotify accounts and netflix accounts through brute force without password guessing. The website also encourages its users not to change password or emails to prevent users like me from changing passwords/emails. 

What really was surprising to me was how inefficient Spotify's account security system was. Sure, even if a hacker hacks me, I should have the free will to access my own account through my email, change the password, and make it more secure. This was not the case. 

Spotify lets you change your email and completely disregard the email you had used previously. **COMPLETELY.** The hacker changed my email and thats it: My account was gone. I could no longer access my account in any way possible because I did not have the email to my account nor password. I could not request a forgotten password because it wouldn't go to my email anymore. 

The only reason I found out was because I received an email saying that my email for spotify changed. That's it. Now imagine if this email went into my spam list? How would I have thought of recovering my account? What if I had no more proof of my subscription purchase? 

There's no two-factor authentication and it's really fucking easy to lose your account if someone knows your credentials. 

To all of those assholes commenting saying I shouldn't be using the same passwords everywhere in a very aggressive way, I don't; don't make assumptions for internet brownie points. 

Spotify gave me back the account, but didn't sound sincere in doing so. It's just business. They lost my respect and my business. I'm done with them.

"Unequivocal Proof that Spotify's Radio feature embarrassingly and literally plays the exact same songs in the same order.http://imgur.com/a/bl0EL

I kicked off a radio station for Kayne West and took screen caps of the play queue that spotify generated. I skipped to the last song in the play queue and took screen caps of the next play queue that loads. I repeated this until you could clearly see things start to repeat in the EXACT SAME ORDER. 
 
In the list above, by the 7th screen cap you can see that the songs from the first screen cap are being repeated in the exact same order except for one song. 
 
Try it for yourself! Open up the play queue and take screen caps of it. Go to the last song of the play queue to load more songs and take screen caps of those. See how long it takes for Spotify to start repeating things in the same order. Why even have a radio function at all if you're only going to repeat a small subset of the millions upon millions of songs you have?! This is the primary reason I am refusing to pay for a subscription to spotify after my free trial is up.

I have a windows 7 PC, an iPhone6, and an iPad air 2.
I have iCloud enabled on all devices.  

Created three playlists inside of iTunes.  One 100% music from apple music streaming, one 100% local files, and one mixed.  

My apple music profile shows up properly on my iOS devices, showing my subscription etc.  ""Followed Artists"" also synced.  But nothing else.  I verified that the cloud and cellular data are enabled for apple music on the iPhone, and the cloud is enabled on the iPad.

My issue is simple: No playlists or music actually syncs to my other devices.  This is a complete dealbreaker.  I spend over an hour searching for potential solutions on multiple forums and trying everything, most suggestions revolved around enabling and disabling cloud settings, none worked. It seems like Apple Music is not a spotify replacement?  

I thought the point was that I could sync music wirelessly and sync playlists across devices.

After letting it upload/sync my library I gave it a few honest goes over a week and have to say it's just as frustrating to use as before. The icing on the cake was I went to play an album I own, but AM only shows me 5 songs from it because it sells the album but just a few songs off it (but I thought it gave me my music in the cloud?)

I remember it being a bit of a nightmare when canceling before, in that albums and songs would get screwed up but I didn't know if that was still a thing and if there's a way to avoid it apart from just loading a backup of my library.

"This is seriously a horrible appMini rant below!

Been using this app since day one and I can honestly say it's the worst Apple software they have done. 

My issues are as follows:

Playlists and songs not saving offline, or when they do, they randomly disappear from being offline - ie to say they are still in the playlist but are not saved to my phone..wtf!

When I travel and change my time zone to be in sync with the local area all my offline saved music is deleted. Why?? I was on a flight recently and I changed the time zone so when I landed I'd be good to go, but I had no idea that by doing so all my offline music I saved for the flight was gone. 

It's just so random this app. At times it will be flawless, however the offline playlists are the worst thing imaginable. 

I have a oldies playlist for 80s tracks. I tap on the cloud button to download the tracks offline. About 12 out of 112 download.  Why won't the other 100 download?

"This is how I know a playlist is going to suck:How do I know when a playlist is a lazy mess, and not worth listening to?

When I see these 3 words:

**""Play on shuffle""**

That's a dead giveaway that the playlist creator dragged *entire albums* into the playlist. And that's a sure sign that the list creator is lazy and isn't making the best list they can. 

This is not to say there aren't perfect albums out there: There are. But when you're trying to create a consistent mood, it's very rare that a bunch of entire albums will fit the bill.

The best playlists are clearly the result of individually added tracks. Not albums.

More often than not when I listen to someone's playlist that's supposed to be listened to ""on shuffle"", it's got tons of whole albums -- and tons of tracks that don't fit.

I'll decide whether to shuffle or not. If you're going to make a playlist, build it the right way -- the slow way -- one track at a time.

Spotify has been really buggy for me lately. Lately, playback has randomly stopped playing on several devices (android and desktop). Spotify Connect is causing issues with other apps. For example, my wife and I share an account on our phones. If I listen to Plex and she plays a song, it will always pause my Plex playback and show a notification that Spotify is being played elsewhere.

"Things that are wrong with Apple MusicI've been using Apple Music for 3ish years now. I quite like the ability to stream and especially music from wherever inside my Apple ecosystem.  
When I made the switch I had around 25.000 songs sitting around locally, however I couldn't help but notice some issues I couldn't get to work yet and it's been increasingly frustrating over the years.  

&nbsp;

a) Obviously Apple tries to match a music title with one in their database to push your music to the cloud, so they can avoid traffic. But this resulted in going from Explicit to Censored, which is extremely annoying. I tried a multitude of things but ""tell Apple Music"" to replace the Censored version with the Explicit one, integrating in my album.  
b) I have some custom music, which was uploaded successfully. However on iPhone when I download the song, it won't let me play it, giving me: ""The operation could not be completed, unknown error occurred (-12894)"". When I delete the song and stream it from the cloud it works for one playback but then the same error occurs. I tried renaming the song and reuploading it to Apple Music, thinking the 320kb/s version's corrupt, but the same error keeps on showing up.  

&nbsp;

It's extremely frustrating to migrate to a streaming service, expecting more flexibility which then ends up resulting in an equal amount of constraints. Is there anyone else experiencing similar issues, or has anyone found a viable workaround for the mentioned issues?",0,3,171.4141099541331

However the new UI... my god. The first and the most obvious thing that caught my eye was the size of the text. Everything was big. Space was wasted with big margins. A playlist that used to fit to my screen now needed about twice the space and I needed to scroll. A neat, simple look was turned into a nightmare. It's like they're trying to force it into the Windows 8 look - which, by the way, is terrible. I'm not using a touch screen on my desktop and I sure as hell do not want to be forced into using a user interface designed for one. We're going backwards in usability here, I'm puzzled how the Spotify QA could let this get into production - then again I know nothing about their methods, so go figure.
    
The bottom line is, they've screwed up. Do you think they'll realize it and roll back to a usable UI?",1,3,2012.107843520578

"The Black Keys El Camino is now on Apple Music! Can't believe they finally got it to happenWow, looks like my instincts were correct about Apple taking on the streaming industry. Theyve got the money and the industry history and thus influence to make streaming services THE place where people listen to music, and thus THE place that artists want their music on.

Stuff like El Camino not being available on Spotify, none of taylor swift, and lots of other stuff not being available, or coming months after release. 

El Camino is now on apple music, and this is sign of the trend towards Spotify losing more and more rights to streaming, and losing revenue. Theyre currently growing, but as Apple continues to fix bugs and enhance the features, they will seriously disrupt Spotify's business. 

In turn, this will mean Spotify is making less money for themsleves (theyre already suffocating), and have less to pay out to artists (Apple already is paying out higher than the rest of the industry because they have the money to do so), meaning even more people will pull their libraries or latest albums or not release on Spotify at all. 

I think the industry should stick with the integrated solutions. Google Play Music and Apple Music for their respective platforms, both of which are available on competing platforms but not as well integrated of course. Apple Music is coming soon to android. 

I just hope Apple adds the 2 or 3 things that Spotify has advantages in for now, which I expect them to. My instincts have been right so far. And my instincts say that Apple has user @ handles for Connect not becasue people desperately need to express themsleves when they comment in Connect (nobody cares about the Ping re release), but rather because Connect is going to be an important platform that theyre going to build up. 

It's already got a Soundcloud-like portion, which is fantastic. An artist can post a demo or unreleased song or a studio recording session teaser, and itll show up in their artist page with the rest of their music, rather than needing a separate soundcloud app or website that is disorganized and casual. 

The Ping-like portion is dumb like I said, nobody cares.

Next part they need to add is public playlists. You should be able to search for someone's @ handle and get their 'profile' where you can see playlists theyve made public. Currently, you can only send a link to your playlists, but they cant be found by any user on Apple Music, and they cant be live updated or collaborated on or anything. I understand apple doesnt want people's playlists to be searchable in the regular search portion, because if someone is into BDSM or something and has a playlist for them and their spouse called ""WHIP ME"" or something, maybe Apple doesnt want their official library to include that playlist. I get that. But at least mirror spotify's social playlists by letting people view them by finding your username, and allow collaboration option. 

Although, I gotta say, finding playlists on apple music by mood is weak. On Spotify, id search something very specific, like ""90s college party"" and there would be one. A long one. One you could put on for an entire party, hand picked by someone who threw a 90s party and picked out the perfect songs and vibes. The best you can hope for on Apple Music is finding a 90s classics playlist, which would probably be about 15-20 songs long (when I make my party playlists, theyre 100 songs long every time. about 6-7 hours, which means theyll last exactly the amount of the party or at least wont have to find a new playlist an hour in). So I do think that they should have a section to search for user-curated playlists. It would be separate from ""Playlists"" in search results. It would specifically say user curated ones. 

And the only other thing is Spotify's ""Connect"" feature. Basically Handoff/Remote combined in one. Handoff isnt supported by itunes/music app at all, which is strange, but im sure it's coming up in the next version of iOS/OS X. However, the implementation is key. Spotify does it over the internet, rather than bluetooth/wifi in proximity. This means that my phone can be on 4g and my macbook can be on wifi, and it'll all just sync up over the cloud. 

Tapping the Spotify Connect button on iPhone shows the Macbook as an option of where to play the audio. You can tap it, and the audio will switch over to your macbook and start playing out of that. It's terribly glitchy, it loses your queue spot and changes up the shuffle and everything, but it's nice that it doesnt require bluetooth and wifi. Ideally apple would do it the same way, over iCloud, but without the glitchy and poorly implemented handoff behavior. 

Also, there's remote. Remote for iOS has not been updated yet to support Apple Music. I suspect this is because they either have a huge update to the remote app that isn't finished yet, or theyre building the functionality into the Music app like Spotify, so it'll be an OS level feature, instead of an extra app. In Spotify, no matter which device youre on, the now playing screen/area shows the same thing. Even if audio is playing out of your macbook, your iPhone shows whats playing on the macbook. If you tap a song on your iPhone, the now playing area shows that song as playing on both your iPhone and macbook, and the audio continues out of the source youve selected (macbook). So it lets you play songs and manage queue all from your iPhone, but have it all be playing out of your macbook. 

If the music app on iOS had a ""remote"" button, that would be satisfactory for me. It could even be a 3d touch thing, where you could peek at what's playing on your macbook, and if you like it, pop in to press play or press handoff. Handoff would happen over iCloud like i said, and it would be included in that remote screen. 

Somebody more talented than me photoshop this please.. Basically, you could have a ""now playing"" on your macbook, with an up next queue all set up, but none of that is on your iPhones Music app. So you tap the remote button, and pull up your macbook's now playing and up next queue, and you can either control it, or switch it to your phone, so that your phone is now playing that, and the up next queue you set up is synced over too, or if you had an album on shuffle, itll sync your place in the album, which is also part of the up next queue (in Spotify, you are unable to modify the queue on a shuffled album. Only queues that you manually created).

I think this is all Apple Music needs to be the dominant service, besides getting that android app out there, and a web app, and generally continuing to fix bugs/refine the ux. Any additional features they add over time will just be icing on the cake. If they add these ones, itll already be #1. With Siri, a better Up Next function, and a superior unified library and advanced library management functions (editing metadata and other cool stuff), and a much more extensive library ui that just looks nicer and highlights artists better, Apple Music is already setting itself up to be better at the basics. Now they just need to implement Spotify's advantages in a better way (the way I described) and refine everything, and then continue improvement.

Once Spotify thinks it can't get any worse for them, and theyre desperately doing whatever they can to get users back and get a revenue they can survive on and pay artists with, Apple will use the student discount part of their contract to pull over those last few student stragglers who said ""I cant tell the difference. both services give me the music I want and I dont care about the features. im used to spotify and it's half the price"", who will then just go for the easier integrated solution for the same $4.99 price. 

Spotify only has 30% of its users actually paying. I expect that as Apple Music expands and becomes more dominant in the public eye, the only people using Spotify will be the same 40 million people who are currently using Spotify Free. They dont care to pay for music, but they dont want to illegally torrent. They dont even want to pay $10 or even $5 a month. They dont care that there's ads. Their other option is just to listen to radio stations in terrible quality with ads and announcers, so Spotify free is better than the next worst solution. These people will stick with the free service, while anybody who has the money to choose, will pick Apple Music or maybe google play. 

Those 20 million premium users will turn into 19.. then 18.. then 15.. then 10.. then 5, then 1. The free service may still be maintained, but there's so little revenue in that, and the payouts are much lower, so more artists will not want to put their stuff there. 

**TL;DR Sorry to any Spotify fans who just think it's more refined and stable right now, but those are things Apple can and will work out. Failing revenue and a mediocre 3rd party team that clearly doesnt care about the details like the library, or the queue, or having a good mobile app, are not things that will work themselves out. Theyve already worked out the bugs and instability mostly (I didn't use spotify in the beginning, but im sure it wasnt perfect at launch. No baby comes out a fully grown adult), but that's the easy stuff that comes with time and development/maturing.**

The harder stuff is money/influence, getting things right, and having integration and good apps.",0,12,1444.1544571736927

Then I added my tracks to  my spotify local files. After a week or so shaking it off I found that a handfull off my tracks where missing from the spotify playlist. (Still safe and sound in their folder on my hard drive) How come? Does spotify remove Swifts music from my own playlists with local files as well?  Just curious. I got them back on spotify now. Just switched to another local folder.  ",1,18,1442.4279939863195

"Tags being different than on SpotifyI've just got Apple Music for free with my phone contract. I've had Spotify for a little while and I've now canceled it . Some songs, usually songs with features have different tags on Apple Music than they do on Spotify. For most people this won't be a problem but for me it is as I use a service called Last Fm which tracks what you listen to, Last Fm thinks two tracks are different because the tags are slightly different.

"TWO spots left in my Spotify Family! Premium for 2.90/mo!If you're interested, PM me your email address! When I have the five people I will send out the details of how to sign on. 

Here's how it will work: payments will be on a monthly basis through PayPal, $2.90 which is just enough to cover the plan bill and PayPal fees. I will send out a reminder email five days before payment due date, if payment is not received by 24 hours before the billing day I will have to remove you from the plan.

Requirements:
USA accounts only. 
PayPal only. 
You cannot be presently enrolled in Spotify Premium, you must be on the free service. If you are premium you will need to create a new account. 
Before I add you to the group plan you will need to change your account's zip code to mine, to satisfy Spotify's requirement of ""same household"".

Leaving the plan is simple, just let me know as far in advance as you can and at the end of the billing cycle I will remove your account.

By the way, I'll make zero money off this and only ask enough to cover the bill and transaction costs.

Any questions, ask below!

"THE WATCHLIST I, II, III UP AND COMING HIP HOP ARTISTSThis is a personal project to bring more attention to budding hip hop artists. While I appreciate collaborations like the XXL Freshman Cover which released this month, the process has become heavily politicized. In an industry as large as the music industry 10-12 artists one one cover a year is not enough to bring proper exposure to new talent. Here are 20 artists every single Month. I have a Spotify Version and a Souncloud Version. All with the same 20 artists but 20 different songs. Below are all three versions of the Spotify Watchlist.

Question about syncing playlists between Spotify and my iPhone: If I add a song to the list on the desktop (web portal via Chromebook), it instantly appears (and downloads) on my iPhone. Awesome. But if I *delete* a song on the desktop, it still remains on my mobile. In order to delete it on the phone, I have to manually do it. Not a big deal, just less awesome.

I assume it's because the tracks on these are downloaded, so I'm essentially playing them offline. I know there's no chance of it being synced live, but I'm wondering if there's a process where I can sync the two afterward? Hope that makes sense!",0,3,45.16593341425889

"Suggesting a modified shuffle algorithm for Spotify.Considering that I have playlists that have songs from different artists and alot of songs from the same artist. I want Spotify to balance between playing songs from different artists and same artist. 
Example:
I have a rock playlist that consist of 100 song.
70 from the same artist (since I like this artist in particular)
30 from different artists. (I like the songs but not the discography of those artist)
Now; you might suggest separating the playlist same and different artist playlist.
I tried that and I didn't like it. When I am in mood to listen for rock. I don't want to keep switching between playlists. I just want to hit shuffel and have a balanced experience listening to same and different artist.
Here comes my suggestion:
If I use true shuffel I will just listen to more songs from the same artist.
So why not add the following features to the shuffel algorithm:
1- Don't play a song from the same artist twice in a row.
2-Don't play back the same song in the playlist till you play all other songs in the playlist even if I went to other playlists or turned off Spotify. (let's call it memory shuffle or queue). This way even when you come back to the playlist and hit shuffle you will resume your last que.
If we applied the past mentioned features. You will enjoy a smooth playlist with no recurrent songs playing again and again.

"Strange behavior suggesting hijacking SpotifyTo start off: I'm very secure savvy overall, I do not use Facebook - my email is 100% secure and my password are all randomly generated regardless of what platform I'm using.  I've been using Spotify for a while, but only recently upgraded to premium. Almost within a week my account started displaying strange behavior of quitting songs in the middle, pausing or playing random tracks I had never heard of. It started playing tracks from an account named ""stuart.piker"". I've no idea who this individual is, and seeing their username appears to be their name I'm quite convinced I've never even known this person.

Naturally I generated a new password, changed the old and tried again. Initially this was to no avail, Stuart would just take control again and play arbitrary songs. So I decided to research this issue, and it appears to be rather common and widespread with Spotify. I would deem the odds of someone having actually hijacked my account about zero, unless there has been a leak on Spotify's behalf. A few hours ago I discovered a button called ""private session"", which would, according to the Spotify manual, prevent it from sharing information with Facebook(not sure why this wouldn't be the default setting in first place). Upon enabling this I no longer experienced Stuart being a clown and going about listening to whatever he pleased. This has however only been a few hours, so perhaps Stuart himself is panicking with the same issue I'm experiencing on his end.

I don't want to throw about accusations, but I think there might be something very wrong with the Spotify service. This is the first time in any application ever anything similar to this happened to me.",1,2,5.9469658333449456

It's got a definitely feel of it being made by one single person, it has a certain style to it (I don't know why but I've decided it is female).



Also odd was that when I realised that it had one follower, but that follower wasn't me. So I followed it and now it has two followers.



Nobody else has my spotify login details and I listen to spotify every day, on the way to work, if I run out to get stuff whilst at work, on the way home for work, at the gym and lots more in the evening. Spend a huge amount of time on the weekend playing it. If somebody else was playing using my account then I would have seen by now. None of this stuff has ever been in my 'recently played' section and my Top Songs of 2017 were all songs that I had played on repeat a lot.



I noticed all this last night and then searched this morning in the actual search bar for 'Top Songs 2018' and two playlists came up. my actual one (that seems to be a fairly accurate representation of my listening habits of 2018, I say fairly as there is still some tracks that I don't really rate in there) and this other one that clearly isn't mine.




Partly I'm utterly mystified and creeped out, partly I'd like to thank this person for introducing me to some cool new stuff.

It's been about a year since I [reached your 10,000 song limit](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/257a98/10000_song_limit_on_your_music/). After I reached it, I [completely reinvented the way I organize music](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/2nbzkj/how_i_use_spotify/) so that I could continue enjoying my time with you. But then you rolled out an update that [broke all that](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/2z5qpe/new_update_1011060gc75ebdfd_mega_discussion/cph9yye) and I was forced to start using a new provider. 



I love that Google Play doesn't create any limitations on the amount of music I can enjoy, but it's still not as good as you, Spotify. If you told me tomorrow that I could have as many songs as I want in my library, I would cancel my Google subscription and come back with my tail between my legs. 

I promise...",1,1,1567.4617324092349

For example, when I go to play A Matter of Time, the first track on my songs list, instead it plays 20 Dollar Nosebleed, the previous first track. I tried resetting my phone but no dice.

I've been back and forth with customer service and all they honestly say is, ""sorry, we'll pass this info on to the right people.""

After reading around online, it seems that I might be able to cancel my family subscription, revert to the free plan, then re-upgrade to premium using my gift cards, then re-invite my wife to our family plan. Totally ridiculous.

I have 386 songs (>26 hours) on my starred playlist, yet in a normal 10 hour work day, the same songs get repeated multiple times? This isn't just on occasion, it's every single day!

Secondly, the last song you queue gets repeated. It happens every time for me on both the OS X and iOS client. If you queue a single song...it always plays twice!

I'm not going to say these bugs are ruining my life, but as somebody with ADHD, I'm getting distracted far too often having to babysit Spotify. I notice every damn time when the same song starts playing from the beginning.. :(

"Spotify shuffle (for android at least) is TERRIBLEI honestly can't describe how bad it is.

Now, I absolutely love Spotify, and it's by far my favourite music service, but my god the shuffle.

I have a lot of Paramore songs in my library, and a bunch of other songs by misc artists. Say I choose a song by Paramore and then press shuffle, the upcoming song list is FULL of Paramore songs. If I choose a non-paramore song and press shuffle, Paramore don't show up for ages.

Another thing. Let's say I didn't like my initial Paramore shuffle, I'll turn shuffle off and on again, right? Wrong. Upon doing that and looking at the queue, it's exactly the same Paramore songs just in a different order, and this is reliable and repeatable. 

How hard is it really for them to do a shuffle that is genuinely just your songs in a random order. I admit that it's possible to get what I experience as a result of randomness, but the chances are so slim that every single reshuffle looks the same, so I doubt that's the case.",1,5,589.1559685230781

"Spotify requires facebook authentication to cancel account. Raging!Hello,

So the other day my girlfriend and I went out and spent all of our money on a new (used) car. I wanted to put my spotify subscription on hold for a couple of weeks as money is tight. When I got to the cancellation page it wanted me to authorize with facebook in order to cancel.

I said no, fuck that, facebook doesn't get to decide when I cancel my services. I sent them a strongly worded email telling them to cancel my subscription and I don't want to authorize facebook to cancel my subscription. 

They sent me back an email saying literally ""don't worry about it."" Then they didn't cancel my account and charged me again the next day. I tried going into my bank today to take care of it and they said since it isn't a fraudulent charge they couldn't reverse the charge but I could get a new debit card number if I can't cancel. They suggested I tried calling the number they had on the charge first.

When I called the number there was an automated response telling me to go online or send in a customer support request (both of which I already did). Defeated and not wanting to cancel my debit card over this I authorized facebook to let me cancel my spotify account. 

I loved spotify, but to me this is unacceptable. I shouldn't have to tell facebook anything to cancel any service except facebook. I sent in a reply demanding a refund but I doubt anything will ever come of it. It'll be the last $10 they ever get from me. ",1,7,1812.3606560233814

"Spotify needs to take greater responsibility with its advertsSpecifically, I am talk about an advert for clinical trials.

More than other adverts, this one caught my ear. For those who haven’t heard it, the advert is for a company offering positions on a clinical trial program. There is a stated incentive: £900 and paid travel with accommodation, and a couple of caveats such as being a non-smoker and being in a certain age bracket. There are also some sentiments about furthering medicine.

My issue with this is an ethical one. Clinical trials have the potential to be dangerous. I don’t have first, or second hand experience, which may mean my argument is misguided, or the motivation for it is misplaced, but having watched [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9_sX93RHOk) (which I would recommend) I would be very uncomfortable with recommending the practice to anyone. I accept this may be a poor or edge-case example, but it is what I am familiar with.

Alarm bells rung louder when I considered who will be listening to this advert. Those who get Spotify adverts are not premium members - they aren't paying for the service. From that a conclusion could be drawn that non-premium members are less better off financially than their premium counterparts. In not only offer the prospect of money, but actually enticing with what I would deem a lucrative figure, I imagine makes the offer extremely tempting for some people. Similarly, I imagine non-premium users on average would be younger than the premium users. This ties-in again with the monetary aspect, and  the programs specifications.
Finally, although this is pure speculation, I imagine there is a sophisticated algorithm for targeting the adverts at people who are most likely to respond. Generally, I think targeted adverts are great - it’s much better getting something that appeals than not - but in this case, I feel it malicious.

Furthermore, it seems so at odds with other adverts on Spotify. This may be the first time I’ve come across this one, but on plenty of occasions I’ve had ones concerning safety at sea, drink driving and sexual disease prevention. Whilst it could be argued that in the long run clinical trials are likewise for the betterment of health, I don’t see this advert as one and the same with the others mentioned.

I don’t take issue with the company whose name I cannot recall - honestly, I think it is well marketed - but Spotify. By nature people are impressionable and although presenting the advert is nothing close to an endorsement, it does suggest Spotify would have no qualms with their users partaking in clinical trials. Perhaps most worryingly, this advert likely got through several layers of the company.",1,0,156.34775093131873
"Spotify needs to make up its mind on how the queue system works.It shouldn't be that hard yet somehow Spotify manages to fuck this one up from both directions.

So I'm listening to an album and I find an album I want to listen to after this one is over. Presumably this is how ""add to queue"" works. No, that adds right after the song I'm listening to now, and then the album I'm in will resume after the ""queued"" album finished.

Right, that's dumb, but okay. Now I'm listening to my queue that I filled up and suddenly decide I want to listen to an album right now. I find the album, hit play, album starts. All good, right? NOPE, first track of the album plays and then it goes back to my queue, with the remainder of the album being thrown at the end, meaning the only way is to *manually clear my queue out*.

"Spotify making changes without listening usersI'm the only one tired of Spotify unnecessary changes?
In the last few months Spotify have been changing the app, mostly removing functions or replacing the existing ones. I understand they need to innovate their app and bring new futures but most of the changes are just unnecessary and pisses of users.

A few weeks ago they removed the Daily Mix playlists, that pissed almost everybody and then after the users start complain they bring it back but now they are limited Playlists and because that wasn't enough they changed the algorithm so all my 6 playlist sound almost the same which is so annoying because they picked up something that was already good and made it bad. Users keep complain about the changes but feels like they didn't care anymore.

Other change for example is the ""Also appears on"" menu, where it used to show singles and albums the artist was featured in, but they just removed it without an explanation. And the thing is the menu wasn't causing any problems on the app and many users used it, people keep complaining about the changes but Spotify does nothing, they just come to the forum with their pre-made text saying they appreciate your review and they are working on it, but they just don't care. 🤦🏻‍♂️😤

"Spotify made me a Racist. Stop the foreign music!Hi Spotify Community,

&#x200B;

Do you know how to fix this issue with foreign music? We need an option to not allow foreign music to be played. It's extremely frustrating when you're listening to a playlist and it starts playing music you can't understand.

&#x200B;

I've been on Spotify since 2012 and never had this issue Spotify until maybe the last 6 months. It mixes a minimum of 5 Spanish songs each day to my 'Release Radar' or 'Discover Weekly', and occasionally a German or French song? Wat...

&#x200B;

I've never listened to any Spanish music on my account, it shouldn't think I understand what they're saying or that I'm interested in this music. I even went through all my playlists and made sure I removed anyone that sings in Spanish such as Pitbull, Camila Cabello, etc. I've hit 'thumb down' on foreign music when it comes up, but it's frustrating to do it multiple times each day.

&#x200B;

I've never had an issue with foreign languages, but now when I hear a Spanish song, I want to flip my desk. I've stopped hanging out with my Mexican friends because I'm afraid of them influencing my Spotify playlists just by proximity. I live in Southern California and now avoid my favorite taco trucks. I caused a 12 car pile up on the freeway trying to thumb down a Spanish song that came up. I broke my wrist and both my legs at the gym trying to change the song. I've never supported building the Trump wall, but if it could influence my Spotify playlists, you've got my vote. Spotify is turning me racist, real talk. I didn't sign up for this!  Ayuadame...",1,5,199.1987926007421
"Spotify literally gets worse with every updateEvery single new update that comes out for this program seems to either remove something useful or dumbs something down. Or both!

Like removing the Ctrl + F feature to seek tracks in large playlists. Why? Because fuck you, that's why. Now they removed the volume slider from the mobile app on iOS, and you can't view the time or see your battery life in the ""Now Playing"" section. Why? Because pretty!

By now I'm terrified every time I have to update. I wish I wasn't so helplessly reliant on it. It's as if some executive over at Spotify Ltd. is pushing out update after update going, ""Hehe, I bet this one will really piss those fuckers off. What are they gonna do, go use Tidal?""

"Spotify lagging my games when changing songAs the title states - my game lags very hard (or the internet really slows down while downloading and stuff) while the song is changing.

"Spotify is the worse piece of software on my Android and on my laptopSo, hear me out. The service itself is alright, probably the best, but everything else is terrible. Do you need examples?

It turns out that Spotify is this tiny puny company (sarcasm) without resources and as such can't create proper native apps on any platform, so it has to use the notoriously lightweight (sarcasm) Chromium framework to share as much code as possible between platforms.

What does this mean? Well, after version 1.0, regardless if you use a Mac or Windows, you will see these ""helper"" processes eating hundreds and hundreds of MB of RAM and the occasional 98% of CPU. This can happen to every single user, regardless if it has happened to you this month or not. For comparison, Windows freaking XP ran fine on my desktop with 256MB of RAM, so no matter one someone might say, this ""chromium framework"" BS results on a fat app with lots of overhead. It's poor and shitty and probably implemented so they could fire/not hire any more programmers and cut costs a bit more.

If you want to do this, why not using webkit? Can anyone enlighten me? I'm not even going to ask for proper native apps.

To make things better, **EVERYONE** has this stupid and inexcusable bug where if you are playing songs from your saved artists or albums, the music will always default to the first song, so you can't select the song that you want. This bug is so pathetic for a company that only does this service, that anyone has to think that this was made on purpose to fuck with free users.

Remember when spotify was enjoyable and lightweight on any sort of devices? Nowadays you kind of need an A10-fusion device and to stay connect to the charger even on our laptops at all times...

This is also why we must hurry for them to transition their disgusting flash-based webplayer to HTML5. Web apps belong in tabs. That way we can also shove adblock software in there for safety reasons, battery and performance reasons and to punish them for crap like this. No sympathy from me.",1,25,927.0387115752533

"Spotify has been literally fucking broken latelyIt constantly says I'm offline when I am connected to the internet and I have to reset the app to fix it
Sometimes I will have only offline search results for like a full 24 hours even though the app let's me visit artist profiles and doesn't say I'm offline
When I tap on a song to play it I have to click shuffle play like 4 times before I can actually choose which songs to play on an album. Also yeah, I do have premium 
When I shuffle play a playlist it only plays some certain artists and maybe like 40 songs in total even though there are like 900 songs on one of my playlists.
For whatever reason has started crashing the background and will take forever to load back up even though my sd card has like 90 gigs of extra space.
Finally, why'd they remove the ability to remove songs you dislike from albums? That was such a great feature and the only reason I can think they removed it for is just so people accedentaly play some songs they dont like on the album so the artist will get a couple more streams and earn more money

"Spotify free users - how interested would you be in an ad ""blocker""?I wrote a little application that hooks onto some win32 functions in order to see what's playing in Spotify. If a known ad is detected as playing, it will bring Spotify's individual master volume down to 5% and play elevator music at normal volume for the duration of the ad. :) Is anyone else interested in using it? I made it last night in a couple hours, so there's probably a bug or three. If there is some interest I'll do some more testing with it and then release it here.

"Spotify doesn't deserve my money until they fix these issues 😡I'm really mad at Spotify. They could be so much better than their competitors if they didn't take stupid decisions.

- Why don't they allow us to ban or at least dislike songs/artists that we don't like? 
This has been mentioned thousands of time like in this [thread](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Block-Hide-Blacklist-tracks-or-artists/idi-p/22389) (closed!)
I know they added this feature to the discovery weekly playlist but it's not enough. Stop forcing me to listen to artists I don't like. Stop wasting my time making me skip music I hate and giving money to those artists.


- The second issue is the shitty radio. Still plays the same 5 bands over and over. Similarly, it's been mentioned thousands of times like [there](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/quot-Ban-quot-artist-from-radio/idi-p/292576)
I've actually changed my account country to Thailand since I moved there. Before it was set to France and I hated being forced to listen to french songs. Now I don't have the radio feature anymore (not yet available here for some reasons) but I don't miss it since it's terrible.


Also pretty much everybody seems to say the shuffle button keeps on repeating the same songs. I've read that sorting them by song name or toggling the repeat button off fixes the issue but I haven't tested it much.

Oh and I won't even mention the Family plan being restricted to people living in the same freaking household (!!) I don't even live in the same country 😞

"Spotify RantThis is another rant, but I hope I’m adding to the discussion.
Spotify is my favorite app.  I’ve got 16 gigs of songs stuck on my phone, so it’s not like I’m going to stop using it anytime soon.  I’ve been an advocate of the streaming service for a year now, always telling my friends about the product, turning them on to it.  However, it’s hard to be a proponent if the product itself is changing in ways you don’t agree with.  Really, it’s just the changes made to the interface, and I think basically everyone else here has agreed for the most part.  Whether it be the removal of two tabs at the bottom of the screen, or the moving of the repeat and queue button, Spotify has lost the seemlessness that drew me to the app in the first place.  In this day in age, we are on our phones constantly.  Things need to be quick and simple when it comes to an app’s interface, especially for the apps that are used the most.  Having certain buttons like the queue and repeat on command should be a given, considering how much we (or at least I) use them.  I don’t know if their doing some sort of study on their app to see what people use and don’t use, but I know that I use those buttons like crazy on the app.  What do I not use?  The green heart.

"Something very very strange is going on with Spotify on Bluetooth in my carI noticed that when driving listening to music that my music always pauses randomly for a few seconds but on the car display it say it is still playing.

It is very infuriating so I did some messing around on Spotify and looking at the car manual for Bluetooth audio playback and nothing.

But then noticed when I play some certain songs, it would ALWAYS pause at the same place for a bit and then join again at the same time. I noticed it because I played that song on repeat so many times for the past month and it was always that song that would pause so I did some testing. 

I played a random song i don’t listen to much on my long list of liked songs and there was no random pausing for these songs. Weird. I then searched up the song I played on repeat on YouTube and then the song’s audio pause at the EXACT place it usually pauses on Spotify wtffff

Does someone have any explanation for this? It literally makes no sense I’m going crazy at the moment on how strange this is even possible. I swear I’m not on any drugs but the audio would cut off in one particular song no matter what platform.

2. Check ""Play DRM-controlled content"" in Firefox Preferences.

But mubo is not a simple jukebox app where you can just up and down vote songs. There is so much more we developed to bring you and your friends a great music experience for your next party :)

**App Features Overview:**

* Host a Musicbox, a music player which allows your friends to vote songs
* Voting: The song with the most votes is played next
* Allow guests to add songs
* Cooldown System (You decide how often your guests receive new votes)
* Set Connection Range: Your guests have to be in this range to connect to your Musicbox
* Pin protection for private Musicbox
* Ghost Mode, Musicbox is invisible and friends connect via QR-Code
* Set a Welcome Message for every guest that connects to your Musicbox
* One playlist for different music sources (Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Fanburst)
* Philips Hue support

For details check our [Website](https://www.mubo-app.com)If you like to try the App you can get it here - [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/musicbox-mubo/id1089676976?ls=1&mt=8) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mubo.musicbox)

What do you think? Do you have any additional ideas for mubo? We would love your feedback!

"So...AM = my personal mp3s go *poof* ?I’m a bit of a noob with Apple Music. Still on the free three month trial, actually. I just activated the function that merges the music on my phone with music on my MacBook through the iCloud music library.

From what I can tell, it does this:

- iCloud scans my entire music library on my Mac and uploads all songs and playlists to my iCloud music library.

- Apple Music attempts to match any songs in my playlists that are available on iTunes and makes them playable on my iPhone.

The thing is, if any songs don’t match (I.e. aren’t available on iTunes) they are not playable on my iPhone. Obviously, a lot of my *personal* music and MP3s like a recording of my kid playing ukulele, or a friend’s recorded DJ set will not be available on iTunes. I can see items like this listed and greyed-out in my phone’s playlists but I’m not able to play them, and I can’t figure out a way to sync them to my phone without also turning off iCloud music library merging.

Is there anyway this can be done?  Am I missing something here, like a function that makes this possible?

"Shout out to Spotify about modded apks and why they should let us pick the song to playYes, I've used a modded apk to play. But it made me love spotify as a platform, it made me install it on my pc and play countless songs, and this made spotify income, for sure.
I would have used the official app, but one thing was missing.

Here are my reasons about why spotify should make song picking not a premium feature:

- People loves finding new song, why stop them? More songs listened = more ads = more revenue

- On other platforms you can pick your songs, why not on mobile?

- More people would use the app, people like me that doesn't mind ads, kinda like a radio, but wishes to pick what to listen to. Leave premium for downloads, high quality, and other stuff, but let us pick, we will pay back with an incredible ad reach

Please think about making this change.

"Shared Playlist Missing SongsHi r/AppleMusic!

I have a shared playlist that two of my friends access via Apple Music. Today I discovered that they are getting 17 songs, 55mins of material... when my playlist is 30 songs, 1hr39mins of material!

The playlist consists of songs from an artist where I owned all of their records until their recent (last 2 years). It appears all of those songs from previous years are the ones missing.

I figured it was because I added the songs which were hard-downloaded into my Music app, not the Apple Music version. So i assumed they couldn't access due to that reason. So, I deleted the songs from my playlist, then went thru the Apple Music interface, to the artist's page, to the album, and then added the songs to the playlist... but the Apple Music versions.

This did not fix the problem. I am still seeing all 30 songs, my friends are still seeing 17.

Did I do the right thing? Is there a way to get those songs to actually show up? Despite going through Apple Music's interface, does it still default to my hard-downloaded versions? 

Lastly... how often should my playlist ""update""? As in... is it instantaneous for my friends when I make a change? Because it seemed there was a huge delay. 

Thanks in advance for any help!",0,7,35.45818580376329

I had thousands of dollars on music in the iTunes Store for years before music streaming apps became available. Frustrating to see that when when I do it the legal way half of it gets taken away and not recognized as being previously purchased when I look the songs back up in the Apple Music section. 

Not only that but also I had synced to my phone via iTunes from albums I had brought and all that music (over 3000 songs) has disappeared completely. Why?

"Removing tracks from library without removing them from playlists.I'm a Spotify refugee and switched to Apple Music mainly for the better library management. I'm enjoying the experience so far, but there is one thing that really bugs me.

It's the fact that deleting a song in your library also deletes it in all your playlists.

I like to keep full length albums in my library but add singles & individual tracks to a playlist. I moved my whole library from Spotify and I'd like to clean it, but I'm struggling to find an easy way.

"Realising why I’ll never use Spotify. Again.So I’ve recently moved to the US from the UK and have had to cancel all my Apple subscriptions to be able to transfer across. In the meantime while I wait for a debit card to be able to restart my Apple Music sub I’ve reverted to using Spotify (my wife has an account).

I used to be a Spotify customer and so had some playlists saved. Decided to hit download on a few and use it for the next few days. I leave for work and hit play. “This doesn’t sound like the song I downloaded, oh its a cover of the song, skip track, next one is a cover, skip track this time its a ringtone of the track”

Seriously, I had this issue in the past which ultimately led me to move to Apple Music but honestly this must be a joke. How does this even happen? I completely get that agreements change and at times these companies (even Apple) lose the right to be able to allow streaming of certain songs, but we are talking 4 out of 10 songs!! This isn’t even unknown or underground bands. Big chart like hits.

Anyone else have this issue? I’ve not had it happen once on Apple Music.  Spotify is a joke, for all their playlists and their playlists aren’t brilliant, they really are miles behind the experience I expect from AM.",0,2,40.95299359899153

They want to control the whole game. I can't even play my music without having to look at their bullshit, even if I pay subscription. fuck off.

"Please vote my suggestion for better download management on the Spotify app>I have subscribed to a lot of playlist and making them available offline causes a lot of headache. Some playlist have entirely new content every week resulting to gigabytes of download every week. To make matters worse, Spotify downloads the files at a time when I really need all the bandwidth (no one is indefinitely connected to a fast WiFi). With those problems, I came up with a list of suggestions that will help people who are not connected to their fast WiFi internet.

>1. Allow us to pause download.
2. Allow us to schedule our next playlist update 
3. Add an option to start download only when connected to a home WiFi.
4. Manual update of playlist.
5. Support for metered WiFi connection
6. Don't download when battery is less than 30%
7. Download only when charging

"Playlist for everyone to get into German RapHi Reddit Community,

I have created a Spotify playlist for everyone who is interested in German Rap and its growing popularity.

For 2 years now, German Hip Hop has become the most popular and most successful music form in Germany. The variety of artists and Hip Hop genres represented has never been bigger. I myself have listened to German rap for over 15 years now and am totally passionate about this type of music.

For those of you who are interested in listening to Hip Hop outside the US (Germany is now the 2nd biggest market for HipHop worldwide), I have created this playlist with my personal favorite songs of the last two years. Give it a try, be open and you might find some new Hip Hop you like to listen to. German Hip Hop has really matured in the last years and the quality of music is better than ever.

Feel free to share this playlist with your friends and enjoy!

But I'm not finding the most simple and basic thing that I need. To sort my list of playlists alphabetically.  When Im trying to add new music to various playlists or play various playlists, it's needlessly frustrating.

"Opinion: Spotify Is Better than Apple Music (x-post from r/Apple)***obviously this is a TOTALLY biased, anecdotal, unscientific experiment. I love Spotify. There. I said it.***

So with the announcement of the HomePod and the speculation/potential that it will only support Apple Music, I thought I'd do a real world, very un-scientifitc comparison between Spotify's and Apple Music's song recommendations. 

This originally began after searching for one of the songs used during the keynote that I liked called ""Feel It Still"" (this song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR5ODc5Wbbo)), and then I figured I might as well do some other songs/genres while I'm at it. I did these tests by going to the selected ""test song,"" and then starting a station from it on both Spotify and AM (""Go to Radio"" and ""Create Station,"" respectively). I then wrote down the 5 next songs each platform suggested after starting a radio station based upon that song in order to see which platform suggests what songs based off the ""test"" song. I tried to include a wide range of musical types, with most of them being released relatively recently.

So there it is. What do you think? Which platform did the best? 

**My Opinion:**
Spotify blew AM out of the water in 3 main categories:


1. Song relevance (defined as = similarity to test song, released around the same time as the test song)
2. Song tempo (defined as = pairing upbeat songs with other upbeat songs & vice versa)
3. New song recommendations (defined as = frequency in which lesser-known songs were selected)

**Song Relevance:**

I feel that Spotify did a much better job at balancing new, fresh recommendations with ""oldies but goodies,"" while AM relied much too heavily on the popular, ""easy pick"" songs in order to compile a good playlists, with no regard to release date. Spotify's choices had plenty of new artists, but retained relevance and overall similar feel. Also, if I selected a newer song on Spotify, it tended to only select newer songs to pair with the test song in most cases, which is ideal when you want to listen to the newest stuff and ""set it and forget it.""  Meanwhile, 

**New song recommendations:**

AM had a tendency to select widely-known, already-popular songs that didn't quite fit, as if it were scared to make the wrong choice by venturing out into the unknown and select a song that is lesser-known. Spotify was much more selective and specific in its selections, often not afraid to stray away from mainstream artists and songs and not afraid to suggest artists I'd never heard of. However, Spotify would still pick awesome, current songs and mix them well into the playlist, giving it a good balance. 

**Song tempo:**

I think the songs selected by Spotify just flowed better. Not only were they similar in style to the test song, but they also matched in energy level and overall feel - whereas AM would be able to keep to a similar genre, but would go from up-beat, energetic songs to slower, duller songs, and also completely random, almost completely different songs. 

*Conclusion:*

**Of course, this is all highly subjective, and I included the song titles and artists so that all of you can go check them all out yourselves and make your own conclusions** about which platform suggested better-fitting song recommendations. Some other shortfalls include the fact that both of these platforms' algorithms make suggestions based upon previous listening, so your mileage most likely will vary. Like I said, this is all anecdotal and opinionated, but thought it might shine a little light on the overall style of each of these platforms.

"Only two people in Apple Support even knows what the personalized playlists AREI was an AM subscriber in 2016-2018, then switched back to Spotify early this year when I moved to Android. Still not a fan of Spotify, so I switched back to AM about six weeks ago. I still haven't had the personalized playlists pop up, so I reached out to Support to ask if there's an issue, when to expect them, etc. So begins my hellish journey.

* The first agent, through email, had no clue and simply said they were the wrong department, please contact a different department.
* The second agent, through chat now, has no clue at all, tells me I need to log in to iCloud Music Library on my Mac. That's already on, so I ask if he wants me to toggle it off then back on again. He says yes, I do it, and he literally says congratulations, problem's fixed, now my music will sync across devices. I tell him that's not AT ALL the issue and reexplain. He says he doesn't know, call tech support, asks if everything is solved, ends the chat.
* Third agent, on the phone now, simply has no idea at all what the personalized playlists are and thinks my For You tab entirely is not showing up. I tell her no, just the playlists. She doesn't know, throws up her hands and escalates it.
* Fourth agent again has NO CLUE what I'm talking about so finally I just pull up a screenshot on Apple's support site of what the playlists look like. She screen shares in to look at my iTunes and I show her the screenshot from Apple's website. She tells me what I found ""in some article"" isn't relevant here and because it's an iPad in the screenshot, it's doubly not relevant because they'll appear different on different platforms. She still has no idea what I'm talking about and says since my For You section is working, there's no problem. ""It's different for everyone because it's FOR YOU."" She's getting really testy with me at this point. I compare Apple's playlists to Spotify Discover Weekly to let her know what I'm talking about and she says ""let's not go outside the Apple ecosystem here"" so I say ""right, but that's the best analogy I can give you as to what I'm talking about. I ask if there's a timeframe I can expect them to show up and she says no. I say, ""so what, like three months? A year? Two years? When is this actually considered a problem in Apple's eyes that an advertised feature that USED TO WORK for me is not working now?"" And she snidely says ""I don't have a timeframe for you."" I ask to speak to someone else and she's very resistant but finally switches.
* Fifth agent finally knows. It takes him a minute to understand because the last person really poisoned the waters, explaining that the whole issue is that my For You section isn't working. After a little while, I ask him if he knows what playlists I'm talking about and he says yes, that Apple has no support documentation on how to fix it though, and says we'll need to move up again.
* SIXTH AGENT now. I have to reexplain every time but she knows exactly what I'm talking about and says there's a note about this where you have to refer to Apple's engineering department for this issue. She tells me she's OOT this weekend so is it OK if we reconvene Monday and I say yes absolutely, that it's not really urgent but I just felt like I was going INSANE talking to these other support agents about features announced in 2015 they still don't believe exists. She laughs and says she knows, it's one of her favorite features and basically all she listens to so she'd want to address it too. I love her. She's gonna call me on Monday.

Six agents over the course of TWO HOURS. Four agents had no idea what I was talking about at all. One was generally familiar but unsure what to do. One knew exactly and knew exactly who to bring it up with.

Why is Apple Support so clueless about these features?? And why is it so tough to get AM personalized playlists to pop up? This was an issue when I was first a subscriber as well and required a call to Apple that time too.",0,10,52.356968748911655

"On a personalized radio how to tell Siri to play a song next without leaving that radio.Hello friends

I have a HomePod and I use Siri enough to play music. But I have a problem, if I tell you to play music of some genre or artist, it creates a radio based on my request. Until there it is fine, however if I want to tell you to put a song next, it does it but it takes me out of the radio I had created before. That is very cumbersome.

How do I just put the song I'm asking and continue with the radio that I believe.

I already tried with all the commands indicated by Siri, even from the iphone it doesn't allow me to put the song I want to add next.

"Oh My God, Spotify is amazing!!!I know about Spotify since many years, as in some *thing* for music like soundcloud maybe or whatever... Never bothered with it. I was getting musically depressed from YouTube, as I was listening to almost same songs like a in looped cluster of videos and not really because I wanted to, it's the autoplay and YT account self-personalization. In YouTube, not only the quality of music is inferior and the wait time between switching songs, getting lost in comments or watching the music video, but I have noticed that you have to know what you want, whereas in Spotify all these problems are gone, plus there are these awesome catogories, playlists and so on.

Got some new headphones and Spotify is amazing. Even the way you can click artists, albums or songs, see related and so on, even upcoming concerts or details... Plus, I discovered a ton of new songs I had no idea that they were out there and still using it. Spotify app is amazing and sound quality and instant change songs/go forward etc is perfect!

Longtime Spotify user but really frustrated.  I have a Family Plan for our 4 person family and my teenage kids are now old enough to enjoy listening to Spotify on the go.  Problem is, even with the Spotify ""Family Plan"" only 3 total devices can listen offline, like on an airplane or a long car ride where we live where there is often spotty cellphone coverage.  

So, one of us gets no offline device opportunity and the other 3 of us get to use it on just a single device (Shoot, I have 3 devices by myself - my phone, iPad and laptop!).  

Just looked it up and Apple Music allows up to 10 devices per person on their Family Music Plan.  Hard to believe Spotify has a 3 device maximum in 2017, seems more like 2007 all over again - looks like I'm not long for Spotify's music service which is a shame because I've really liked it all these years.

"OK, why is Spotify such a piece of shit now?I love Spotify, or I used to at least. After the death of my filled 160GB iPod classic and the endless wrangling and management of iTunes I decided to jump ships and try out Spotify. By the end of the first day I was Premium. I was enamoured. Everything I loved any time, anywhere, on any thing. 

Now I can't stand the useless thing. On my phone it takes minutes to load, the screen hangs and if I accidentally leave it as the open app it stops my phone screen from waking. Half the time it refuses to believe it's connected to the internet regardless of 4G or Wi-Fi signal- I was hopeful it was just a bug with my old Nexus; alas, it was not. 

Despite the endless mobile updates slowly strangling the application into a choked, garbled mess of ever-changing UI elements and poorly functioning features that took 5 minutes to start working I took solace in the desktop app. 

Now even that is bugged beyond all belief. Now whenever I try to play songs (including locally or favourited tunes) it simply skips endlessly with pale blue ""can't play current track"" banner flickering like a strobe as it hopelessly chugs through playlists and albums.

I just want to listen to some music! Someone please tell me I'm retarded and help me fix this so I don't lose my shit any further about something I once adored. ",1,4,1385.8957601879981

"New to Spotify, coming from Rdio, have a few questions:1 - Is Spotify really that bad at syncing? I mean, I was listening to something at my phone. When I get home I open it at my computer and it doesn't pick up where I left from. Even the ""history"" is different. 

2 - Is there a way for me to just launch a station that will play the songs I like? Rdio have something called ""You FM"". You just press play and it'll play songs and bands based on the artists in your collection (or that you fav'd). How can I accomplish something similar on Spotify? I have to manually set up playlists or one-artist-based stations?

2) When I ask it to play a specific artist, it will pick about 20 random songs from that band and then start over at the beginning instead of just continuing to play through that bands entire library.

"New app design is a worrying development for album listenersI'm sure many of you have seen the new [UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/84d18e/spotifys_new_ui/) which looks to be heading in a direction where albums are becoming redundant on Spotify. This combined with the fact that there is a limit of 10,00 saved songs makes life difficult for those of us who love albums and listening to lots of music. I've tried both Apple Music and Google Play Music but both are miles behind Spotify in app design for mobile and desktop. I've been using Spotify for about 4 years and it has been an incredible tool in putting virtually all recorded music at my finger tips. 

This movement away from the traditional album format has been happening for years now but I don't see why Spotify alienates hardcore music fans by having such a relatively small ceiling for saved songs and by making searching for full albums so awkward.

If anyone has any workarounds it would be much appreciated because at the moment I'm just putting unsaving thousands of songs in my playlists. ",1,0,574.1345333393634

"New Spotify client is worse than the open source client I never finished back in 2010This is really hillarious. This night I dreamt I got my Spotify client updated to the new design, but in the dream it was much cooler than in reality. In fact, this brought back much of the pre 1.x functionality, alongside with some games. Then someone told me that I've been sent the internal version of Spotify client that employees would use.
 Today, I discovered that my client on OS X got the new design, and as many states, it is really ridiculous. I can't even drag tracks to playlists anymore, the quality is worse than the open source client I built back in 2010 (sorry not available anymore). 
 I suspect this is a consequence of Spotify's constant loss, they cannot afford to create somewhat decent quality anymore.

I really loved Spotify, this feels so sad. My favorite software has become so terrible bad now.

I noticed one curious thing that new music mix acts like Discovery Mix more (also read New Music Mix description), just in case if people think that it is new music mix from artists in my library... 
BUT
If you want to listen to endless mix with new releases from artist which are already in you library just ask Siri to play new music and you will get real endless New Music Mix... 

Maybe they will split them up officially soon and that will be more obvious) 

So I separate them in such way, because recently noticed that in my New Music Mix there  are no my favorite artists so I search for music manually...

"My theory about Apple, Spotify, and battery life.So I’ve been having some major issues with battery life, have been ever since I moved over to Spotify about a year ago (as a result of Apple’s lunatic decision to make Apple Music look very bad in my opinion, but I digress).

Anyway, the problem began on iOS 10. Spotify would use around 40-50% of my battery life. We’re talking my phone would go from 100% to 0% when using Spotify for 3 hours. Absolutely infuriating. And almost pushed me to drop Spotify.

However I realized some things. The cause is Spotify go/active or whatever they call it where you can control which device music is played on. It’s annoying you can’t turn off this feature but whatever, I kept digging. Eventually I learned that if I turn off wifi it would fix the issue (presumably because Spotify active is turned off). So I was able to survive, wasting a lot of data, but I have an unlimited plan so it was doable. (Note that being in offline mode does nothing to mitigate the problem)

But then one day I did something, I turned off statistics for Apple (in the privacy setting) and boom, the problem was solved.

However, with the recent “upgrade” to iOS 11 Spotify has once again begun shitting itself in terms of my battery performance. With the stats turned off.

So I have a couple theories. The most prevalent of which, and believable being that Apple is collecting data without consent in a similar fashion to the statistics. By doing this it messes with the Spotify code and as a result causes my battery life to drain like crazy.

The second theory is that Apple is actively sabotaging Spotify by ruining their battery life. Why this has not been addressed by Spotify  (as others are having the same problem) is beyond me.

Regardless, idgaf about any of the company sabotage or even being spied on, even though I’d obviously prefer it not be the case, I just want spotify to work properly. So please can someone do something about this?

Also, I realize there are many other potential factors for the cause of this but given that turning off stats fixed it in the past makes me sceptical it’s not a malignant issue. Although, it may be some form of encryption or something?

Ether way if anyone has any info on how to fix this infuriating issue please do let me know :)",1,9,737.4398226897583

Solution:

Make sure you are connected to your apple music. You can check this by going to Settings > Right at the top where it shows your apple ID > Name, Phone Numbers, Email. There make sure it is your ICloud email. 

&#x200B;

 Then go to your Apple Music app > top right where there is an avatar or your picture > View Apple ID (at the bottom) > And make sure it is the icloud that you put in earlier.

"My Spotify account was hacked and I recently got it backLike the title says, someone in Brazil hacked my account, and I got it back. When I got it back, my discover weekly and daily was all in Portuguese, and I had to ""Dislike"" or ""do not play"" a lot of songs to correct the algorithm. I logged on some time last week and noticed the ""do not play"" is gone.  I can no longer block songs or artists I don't want to hear.  This affected me with the new ""Repeats"" and ""Repeat/Rewinds"" auto playlist, its all in Portuguese. 

So i googled the issue and found an idea submission that was immediately closed by Spotify.  They closed it because they said it was a duplicate post.  They posted a hyperlink to the post the ""answered"" the original posters question, but instead, it was a link to another closed post in 2017. So basically they blew him off. 

So im here hoping some of you are like me and do like to use this option.  So i submitted my own idea to Spotify that requires a few votes for them to look at it.

"Moved to SpotifyAfter 3+ years of Apple Music I’ve decided to switch to Spotify.

Here are my reasons:

- Library: Apple Music would often make my library a mess by splitting albums/compilations. 
If you decide to delete/re-add an item to clean up the library it would remove it from any playlists you have created. 

I haven’t come across this problem on Spotify and have noticed that there is a lot more care taken on an artists page. Probably because they prioritise the streaming service. When I visit an artists page I am rarely presented with several versions of the same album like on Apple Music and when I look at the artists music I have in my library everything has an image and looks complete. 

- Community - I like the idea of curating playlists, sharing them and gaining a following whilst searching for new music. Although this is achievable via Apple Music I feel the community isn’t big enough at the moment. 

- Algorithms - My main goal is to listen to new music. I would listen to my ‘New Music’ playlist from Apple every week and it would be very hit or miss. Even if I knew an artist had a new track out and have all of their material in my library Apple Music would often miss the obvious choice for the playlist.

So far after adding my library to Spotify I’ve been recommended some great new tracks and find navigating through similar artists to stumble across something new is much more enjoyable.

- Integration - Mobile, desktop, tablet, chrome cast, PS4, smart TV. Spotify seems to be available everywhere I need it. 

—

What I’ll miss from Apple Music:

- Beats1: I will miss listening  to Echo Chamber, Time Crisis and The Alligator Hour 😕

- CarPlay: Apple Music works really well with my car via CarPlay. Library displayed on dashboard etc.

- iDevice Compatibility: Owning a few Apple devices I liked that everything is in sync across the devices. 

—

Negative things I have noticed in Spotify - 10,000 song library limit.
This really surprised me. When adding my Apple Music library across to Spotify I got a little carried away and decided to add more/all albums by each artist. I then reached a limit and was not allowed to add any more. You can easily save albums as playlists for each album but that could get messy.
Lots of room at the moment but hopefully this is something Spotify addresses ASAP. 

—

Every year when Spotify releases its stats and the community comes alive I often think I’m missing out on Apple Music and decided to jump ship this year. 3 months for 99p/£9.99 also helped attract me.

"Merging iTunes library with iCloud library struggles please help.so I got Apple Music and merge my libraries (most of it is music that wasn't purchased through iTunes Store) and turned on the iCloud library to access the music from Apple Music on my library. problem, certain albums decided to change the album artwork which I've picked out on my own to something else. some album covers still fit the artist but others where wildly wrong.

"MAKE SPOTIFY GREAT AGAIN!With the most recent update, spotify has completely ruined the beautiful, organized, and simplistic layout of the library tab. For me personally, the worst part of the update is the artists page. Prior to the update, the artists page contained any artist of a song you've liked. Its was essentially just your entire library, organized by artist. With the update, this no longer exists. The only artists who appear are ones you follow. There is no more liking a song, then later finding that artist in the artist tab. This has made creating playlist far more difficult.

"MAKE AVAILABLE OFFLINEHonestly, where do I start.

I had around 100Gb of music downloaded to my iPhone, some of which was there before I subscribed to Apple Music. I got up to drive to work one morning this week, plugged my phone in as usual and selected shuffle on a 600 track recently added smart playlist, after around 30 minutes I noticed that I had just listened to the track that was currently playing so I click next and that had just been on too, same again, same again.

When I arrived at work I opened my recently added 600 track smart playlist and it all looked to be there. Again I tried to shuffle the playlist and it was just skipping through multiple songs until it reached on of the tracks that was repeat playing in the car.

After messing around with the only show tracks available for offline listening function I re-opened the playlist and there was only 11 tracks there!?? After getting frustrated I decided to delete all of the music from my device and start again when I get home, my plan was to wipe all of the music from the device and re-download my 600 track playlist again.

So I delete all the music from the storage sections of the settings app, go to 'about' in the settings to check the data has been deleted form my phone and to my surprise I have 13Gb available and 100Gb taken up!?

So now I have no music available to listen to offline but 100Gb apparently taken up on my device.

I have re-tried downloading the playlist and it appears to try to download 500 odd tracks but again they are never available to play when I'm offline... Unbelievable really.

Anyone else experiencing anything similar to this or am I on my own in a world of storage loss and unavailable music?

"Love/Unlove/Suggest Less not syncing across iOS to MacOS/WindowsSometime over the last week, choosing Love, Unlove, or Suggest Less stopped syncing between my iPhone and iTunes on both MacOS and Windows - changes in Love status on my phone are not reflected on iTunes or vice versa.

Initially I thought was the latest 13.1 public beta, but today I restored my phone back to 13.0 using iTunes/IPSW and the problem persists. Sync Library is enabled in Music app settings.

"Lost all my musicHi,

So I signed out of my Apple ID for a reason and then why I signed back in I lost all my music , I’ve got ICloud library sync on and I’ve got the latest software and it doesn’t show up .

On the recent searches bar I’ve still got what I searched for but no music that I downloaded .
I’ve already contacted Apple and they said they’d get back to me but I thought maybe the people of reddit knew.

"Lossless, Lossless, Lossless.I've really tried to convince myself that Apple Music's sound quality is adequate since it's the most seamless streaming service but I can hear a difference on the music I'm most familiar with between a lossless copy ripped from a CD (or from Tidal hi-fi) and the version on Apple Music. On one hand I am an audiophile and do spend my money on a audiophile gear and opted for the Harman Kardon sound system (while I realize I may notice the difference more so on a pair of headphones as some audiophiles consider even high-end factory car audio systems to provide average sound o_O) in my vehicle so I can appreciate the difference. On the other hand, the majority of listeners are totally ok with even lower quality than Apple Music, or listening with EarPods. But once you go lossless you don't go back. It's the drum beat hitting harder and sounding more detailed, it's the guitar having a newfound fullness to it, it's a treble that's crystal-clear and well-seperated, it's vocals coming through with the clarity of the lead singer being in the room with you as it feels like you're surrounded by a live band. Jay-Z and Tidal aren't wrong by stating that lossless is more about the emotion: you get all the sound frequencies rather than a compressed experience, it simply feels better.

My theory has been that Apple is waiting to introduce a lossless music option as a way to to tout a benefit to the removal of the headphone port, so I can wait till September but I could very well switch back to Tidal and pay double just to enjoy my music. Once you go lossless on a quality pair of headphones or a high-end sound system, songs just won't feel the same compressed.",0,20,1178.8291099473392

"Looking for followers and new people to followI am quite frustrated with the unfriendliness of discovery in Apple Music. I would like to be able to do searches of users that have certain things, but Apple Music only allows me to search for usernames or be happy with the suggestions it gives which are 100% useless.

&#x200B;

Apple should allow user searches with some filtering such as:

* Has more than n public playlists
* Likes alternative and dislikes rap
* Has more than n followers
* Etc.

Until something like this is available, we are all trying to find alternative ways to connect. Hopefully this will hit some people with similar tastes to mine and allow us to follow each other. I personally like alternative, rock, latin and brazilian, some jazz and a bit of classical. I have many playlists for others to hear and I'm always trying to find some new music.

"Long-time Pandora user finally trying Spotify and I don't see the appeal. Am I missing something?I've used Pandora (free account) for years. I like being able to pick an artist/song and have it play similar songs. I've been introduced to some pretty cool music that way.

My biggest gripe with Pandora has been not being able to play a specific song on demand (which I always heard you can do on Spotify). But also, how many live/remix versions of songs show up that I don't want to hear, and how repetitive the Pandora stations feel to me.

I've always eyed Spotify as an alternative, but never actually tried it until a few days ago... and I just don't get it. You can search for a song and then start Shuffle Play, which seems to be the equivalent of Pandora's stations. From what I can tell, both Pandora and Spotify's premium seem to also offer the same features (including on-demand playback) for the same price.

So, what's the reason to choose Spotify over Pandora? Or to choose Spotify Premium over Pandora Premium? Would love to hear others thoughts.",1,4,269.46111898708403

"Local files as albums?So I'm potentially swapping to Spotify or Apple Music from Google Play Music since it'll be closing down at some point in favor of Youtube Music (+ Spotify & AM have bigger libraries). 

I'm trying to add in a few albums that aren't on Spotify through the Local Files section. From what I'm seeing online and experience, it doesn't look like you can integrate the Local Files with my actual Library. Whereas with GPM & AM, you can freely upload the files and have be apart of the Library. 

Is there any way around this? I really like the UI of Spotify (mobile & desktop), podcasts in the same mobile, discovery, etc., but not being able to have albums being integrated is a bit a let down. The only thing I think of doing is just create a playlist for each album.

Example: I have Frank Ocean's Endless album, but that's not on Spotify. Is the best bet to create a playlist for that album?

I also do like be able to the shuffle my entire Library, and it doesn't seem like you can do that without adding all my music into a playlist (if so, I'm cool with that).

"Let's talk about good & bad playlistsAlright, [orbat](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1ksrpg/meta_dont_downvote_playlists_just_because_you/) & [me](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1jswdd/on_updownvoting_playlists/) both started posts regarding down-voting playlists.

Let's try to find some points, which qualify a ""good"", up-vote-worthy playlist and what disqualifies a playlist, ok?

* full-album-playlists == bad
    * exception: complete Diskography-playlists for artists /w more than one project

* playlists /w artist-blocks (several songs by the same artist / band in a row) == bad

* **too much** switching between themes/genres == bad (via [Rocket_AU](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1l03b2/lets_talk_about_good_bad_playlists/cbuidtx))

* playlists thate are not carefully handpicked (i.e. same song more than once, high influence by a few artists/bands, filled /w live versions, covers…) (via [WhiteJokeAboutPenis](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1l03b2/lets_talk_about_good_bad_playlists/cbvpdwj))

"Let's talk about Spotify/Siri integration.I'm not seeing a consistent formula for getting stuff to play correctly.

So for instance, saying ""Play <artist> <album> on spotify"" won't work, but saying ""Play <artist> album <album> on spotify"" works. Then for another artist I'll say ""Play <artist> album <album> on spotify"" and it won't work, but ""Play <artist> <album> on spotify"" will work. 

Sometimes saying just ""Play <album> on spotify"" works, sometimes it doesn't depending on album. Saying ""Play <artist> on spotify"" doesn't work consistently either. 

I've been unsuccessful in getting specific songs to play. I was unable to get the album ""The Boy with the Arab Strap"" to play using any method. 

Below are some examples of inconsistencies. 

(I left in capitalization as transcribed by Siri)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing 'This is Yeah Yeah Yeahs' from Spotify* (Playlist, incorrect)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs album it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing It's Blitz! by Yeah Yeah Yeahs from Spotify* (Oh hey, that works)

**""Play Lou Reed album transformer on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'Lou Reed' in your music* (...okay?)

**""Play Lou Reed transformer on Spotify""**  

*Here's 'Transformer' by Lou Reed on Spotify* (correct)

**""Play Belle and Sebastian The Boy with the Arab strap on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'The Boy with the Arab strap' in your music*

**""Play belle and Sebastian album the boy with the Arab strap on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'belle and Sebastian' in your music.*

**""Play the boy with the Arab strap on Spotify""**  

*Sorry, I couldn't find 'the boy with the Arab strap in your music*  

**""Play it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing It's Blitz! by yeah Yeah Yeahs on Spotify* (??????)

**""Play transformer on Spotify""**  

*Now playing 'Transformer (feat. Nicki Minaj) by Future from Spotify.* (this one really threw me because I couldn't figure out how to play individual songs, but there must be a way)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs on Spotify""**  

*Here's 'This is Yeah Yeah Yeahs' from Spotify*

**""Play Dinosaur Jr. on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'Dinosaur Jr. in your music*

"LPT (Life Pro Tip) - You can play spotify off of two devices if one (mobile) is in Airplane Mode and has items downloaded to it.Title says it all.  I just came across (realized) this earlier today.  I'm at my computer w/ Spotify playing online.  My phone (HTC ONE) is in airplane mode playing a playlist that I have downloaded to the device.  It seems as if the mobile device takes precedence, once a new track is played, either through the current track ending or selecting another track the playback on my PC stops with the normal message about multiple devices.

Although, it seems that you can keep on switching tracks on a PC and the playback won't be interrupted on the mobile device until it switches to the next track.

I know this may be ""alerting"" the Spotify Devs of this tip that frequent this subreddit, but I don't really see a way for them to do away with it other than eliminating the possibility of offline playback (or shooting down that idea entirely) unless there is an active internet connection which would be BS.  That really kills the whole idea of being able to make songs available offline....",1,3,2082.245575003762

"I’m confused how this could be so bad.I switched to Apple Music from Pandora two months ago. I just canceled and switched back. 
  
Apples’ idea of “Create station from song” is to place the track you selected into a playlist with about 12-15 other songs that only loosely related by virtue of being performed in the same language.  
   

I’m listening to an Alan Walker song. Electronic.    Create station.  It starts playing “Sorry” by Justin Bieber followed by “Turn Down for what” by Lil John. 
 

I’m glad the original Apple Maps team weren’t all fired, but apparently they were all moved to Apple Music.  Jesus Christ it’s so bad it’s embarrassing. 
  

It hardly seems to matter what genre you choose. The playlists it throws together is extremely hit or miss.

1. Press hard/long (depending on if your device has 3D Touch or not)
2. Lift your finger and scroll if the option you want is off-screen
3. Lift your finger again to make a selection

"Is it time I call it quits on Apple Music?I gave Apple Music's free trial a go last summer and liked it enough to pay $10/month for the service. I was having no issues. I did sort of debate if it was worthwhile; what particularly got me was that I would be forced to maintain this payment for my whole life if I wanted to keep my collection of music. But alas, I gave it a shot.

Since that time, I've moved to a more rural area (which is where I'm settling permanently, might I add) with an internet connection that leaves much to be desired. Seems to be at some point after the move that I've started having trouble with Apple Music. My two biggest issues are:

1) Sometimes due to the poor internet connection, I have trouble downloading songs. Sometimes it doesn't work at ALL. Yet the Internet may work for other things. Just not Apple Music. It just seems to not download, period, rendering the music inaccessible. 

2) A lot of music has become greyed out. This includes some of my personal music and also my adds on Apple Music. If I have wifi, it's not so much an issue, but when I'm on the road (which is where I do most of my music listening), a huge chunk of my music will not play. I have to keep pressing ""next"", sometimes 10 times, before I get to a song that plays.

"Is Spotify something I should be spending my $10/month music budget on?I recently took the Spotify offer of 3 months for $0.99/month and I'm honestly already thinking of cancelling. I'll list why but I'm curious if anyone can rebuttal any of my points or add anything to my points. I may also list a few positives.(Indicated with a + or -)  


TL;DR: -Terrible queues, -sucks for free users, -don't care about artists, -broken features, +/-support annoying to find but fast and respectful, +Discord integration, -lightweight.  


**1 - Queue is terrible on both mobile and PC**

Great, I have a list of all the music that's going to come up but I can't return to a point in the queue without spamming the ""previous"" button? Seriously?  
I know there is a history section on the PC app but I found it just replaces your current queue with that one song. Perhaps it's just not working (like a few other features I've tried to use) but I haven't been able to find any issues with it.

&#x200B;

**2 - They don't care about free users**

I only upgraded to premium because of the offer but my experience with the free version was pretty terrible. I had **no** idea about *why* I should upgrade except to make it less annoying. They didn't try and sell me any features or anything, they just threw as many annoying ads at me as they could. The ads weren't even original either!

&#x200B;

**3 - They don't care about artists**

I expect quality music from the artists I like. I don't enjoy listening to artists like Drake or whoever else there are like him. I enjoy music from people like S3RL, anyone from the Monstercat family and Infected Mushrooms Psytrance. While some of these artists are big enough they likely don't rely too heavily on streaming service revenue, others are not. They don't pay artists anywhere near well enough, especially indie artists. Why do premium streams get artists more revenue than free streams?

&#x200B;

**4 - A few features I've tried straight up don't work**

I'm specifically thinking of the ""Devices Available"" tab not showing any devices while it clearly knows I'm listening on my phone. The integration they have with Discord will update when a song changes on my phone (as long as Spotify is running on my PC). I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling and even resetting my phone but nothing worked. I would contact support but....  


**5 - Support is terrible**

Not the people, the people are lovely and I'm thankful for them but the way it's set up is horrible. The only, and hopefully last time, I used support was when my account was deactivated for some reason (I got emails about it, followed the instructions but it still got deactivated????). I had to go through numerous redirects to find a support I *didn't* have to log in for. That being said....  


**6 + Support is fast**

The one time I had to use support, my issue was dealt with very quickly and the person helping me was very kind and patient with me.  


**7 + Discord Integration**

I game quite a bit so it's nice having a feature where it shows what I'm listening to on Discord and I can invite other users (sadly they also must have premium) to listen with me. Problem is, I wouldn't have known about it if I wasn't there when it was implemented.  


**8 + PC app uses very few resources**

I don't have the most powerful PC and I do enjoy playing quite a few games that I *need* every frame I can get per second. The app being lightweight and easy for my PC to run (and actually functional) is appreciated.

"Intrusive Popups on MobileI just added the following ""Idea"" to the Spotify Community since I've been seeing more popups lately in the app. I know they're suggestions and not ads, but they still get in the way especially when you're driving and have limited attention. These get closed without votes so I'm posting here in hopes some of you agree. Here's the relevant text I posted, you only need to visit the link if you're going to add a vote of support so it gets seen by the Spotify team.

 \------

I have been noticing occasional popups lately in the Spotify Android  App. While I like that Spotify gives me recommendations, I don't want  them pushed in my face when I'm trying to do something else. Especially  if I'm driving and just trying to start my music without taking my  attention from the road.

I think the ""currently listening  from another device"" popup is an exception - it makes sense to have that  one. Music suggestions or new feature notice popups are not good.

I'd  be content with an option to turn this off, but please reconsider  anything that requires a link called ""dismiss."" I know it probably  drives user actions that you want or maybe just actions that happen to  be one of the metrics you measure, but it's unpleasant when you're in a  hurry and dangerous for drivers.

"Interesting bug that rewrites songs and then deletes the original fileNote: I use Apple Music on a 4s with iOS 9.3.5, in case that matters.

The issue regards music that I had on my phone previously, and is an artist that Apple Music doesn't support (The Stabilizers), so I can't go redownload it. A couple of the songs in the album rewrote some songs under other artists (in my specific case, the song Now I Hear You by Stabilizers rewrote Looking for Tracy Tzu by Carpenter Brut). To fix it, I deleted Tracy Tzu and redownloaded it, and now it works fine. However, the file for Stabilizers has been deleted from my phone.

Normally this wouldn't be much of a problem if I could download that music from Apple Music again, but in this case I can't. For now I can't download that song back off of my computer, because for whatever reason you can't download from iTunes while cloud sharing is on, and turning it off wipes the entire library.

On a side note, why can't you download files from your iTunes account with it on? That seems very unintuitive and isn't user friendly.",0,0,825.9306377297916

"Instructions to import music from Spotify into Google Music and say goodbye to SpotifyHere is how I imported my music from last.fm and from Spotify into Google Music. Post here if you need help.

**To import from Spotify playlists to Google Music:**

1. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/jlund/spotify-export
2. Convert the output to match the format of https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist/blob/master/ExamplePlaylist.txt
3. Use gmusic-playlist to import to Google Music: https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist

A video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA4JRCL7d-Q

**And as a bonus...to import last.fm tracks into Google Music:**

1. Export loved tracks from Last.fm via the ""Export"" link on your last.fm ""loved"" tracks page (http://www.last.fm/user/yourusername/library/loved)
2. Convert the output to match the format of https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist/blob/master/ExamplePlaylist.txt
3. Use gmusic-playlist to import to Google Music: https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist

Note this did have the side effect of replacing a small amount of songs with cover songs, and I'm finding a handful of songs in my library that were never there before.

"In defence of the new UI: the albums and artists page were redundant before, now they actually have a purposeI vastly prefer the new UI over the old one, and here's why: It gets rid of redundant pages and gives them a new purpose.

&#x200B;

Before the update, the Songs, Albums and Artists pages would all have the exact same songs ordered in a different manner, making them completely useless, since you can **already** sort your Songs page by both artists and albums.

Now, these pages only have Albums and Artists you specifically like. There are some albums I like to listen to in their entirety, those are now in albums. In Artists I have a bunch of Artists I frequently listen to, and not every single artist I've liked a single song of.

Also, Songs (now ""Liked Songs"") are now in the playlist page as if they were another playlist, making both them and playlists accessible with a single press (as opposed to 2 before).

The play count didn't add up to me, and it was probably due to the fact that I'm one of those people that skip songs halfway through songs (even though I enjoy what I'm listening to).   


**Apple Music isn't counting skipped songs as plays.**  


Apple Music only counts full track listens as a play count it seems. My concern is if this type of metric is preventing users from seeing a Favorites Mix, because you haven't registered enough plays to generate a mix.  


I start a track like ""Starboy"" from the Weeknd 100x, listen for 2/3 of the track but not finish it – does AM know that I really enjoy this song? If I listen to the track fully from start to finish, it should know I like it even more.

"I've been a premium member for nearly a decade...now I'm leaving, and this is whyDriving down the road with my 3k of downloaded songs for offline use.  Pull off to a rest stop, take a break, then get back in my car and continue down the road.  

I feel like changing playlists, so I open the app and every single song of my 3060 downloaded have undownloaded themselves from my device (iPhone 8.)  I check my data usage from the Spotify app and I've blown through 1.2 gb of data in the time I've been in the car.

I've been with Spotify for years; nothing like this has ever happened before.

I understand some people have unlimited data, but I'm not one of them; 1.2 gb is a big amount of my monthly limit.

I find it absolutely absurd that out of the blue, all my songs just become removed from my device.  It's inexcusable.  

I don't think it's worth paying $10.91 per month and always have the suspicion over my shoulder that something like this will happen again.  

The hours it takes to redownload songs, and now the lack of data I have for the rest of the month have completely killed my love for Spotify.

"I'm using iCloud Music Library for the first time and I have questionsI've been trying to get answers from Apple's support page, blog and news articles, as well as posts from this sub, but I haven't seen a straight answer.

So, I have a few albums that are not available on iTunes and Apple Music—mostly ones from obscure bands or those who have disbanded, or from friends—that I want to upload. Here are my questions:

1. Would it be possible to upload them to the cloud, but **NOT** download them *locally* to my iPhone? Can I stream them directly from the cloud?

2. If the music is from someone who already has an artist page, will the songs/albums I uploaded appear there? Similarly, if the artist isn't on Apple Music, will a *non-public* artist page be ""created""? How do I go about accessing the ones I uploaded?

3. Has anyone tried uploading MP3 or AAC files? Did you have any success? Were the files accepted? I've seen Apple's support page stating these formats are not supported, but some people claim to have done it successfully.

4. Out of curiosity for those who are OCD about metadata or tags, do you complete all details for the tracks you upload (for instance, do you list all the writers, label and so on, or just the artist/album artist, album, year released, genre, track number, title)?

"I'm out. Cancelled my premium and deleted the appAfter 2 years of Premium, I'm done with Spotify. 

* The app hasn't gotten any better in those 2 years, it's only gotten worse.

* Same for the desktop app, less features for no reason

* they completely disregard legitimate features requests that everyone wants (fix shuffle, 10k library limit)

* shuffle is definitely broken. It just does weird shit.

* artist promotion is just silly. If I'm paying for the service I don't want you pushing advertising/sponsored shit on me

* no way to track ratings for general music listening (only in radio). On Google Play I can thumbs up anything (even music in my own library) and it auto generates a playlist of Thumbs Up content.

* no way to hide/blacklist artists or thumbs-down stuff (again, except in radio)

* mobile app recently started hanging/locking up when playing, restarting songs after pausing/resuming, other weird streaming issues

* mobile app lyrics window constantly pops forward, doesn't honor being dismissed

* no easy way to add/sync songs not in Spotify. It's a HUGE hassle 

I used to exclusively use Google Play but it was buggy when streaming and didn't have a ton of other features. Also the were was no way to bi-directionally sync whats in your Google Play library with whats in your home library (like you delete a song from you home library and Google Play doesn't know). But the entire time I've used Spotify, I've also still used Google Play because in some situations it was the only way to do certain things. Turns out Google Play has improved notably in the last couple years and now I'm happy with it and totally done with Spotify's shit. I hope for everyone else's sake that Spotify turns the ship around, but I doubt it, and I'm not going to support them anymore.

"I'm done with AM and SpotifyBoth of these services, IMO, do not offer what I need. I've used them both for a total of 2-3 yeas each, and opened multiple tickets with Apple Support.

AM is the best for putting your collection in the cloud, but is constantly rewriting metadata/editing albums/changing music due to contract issues. It has ok music recommendations. So its bad for people who have large, organized collections and ok for people who want new music. (I've tried match..its even worse than AM)

Spotify can't upload my music to the cloud (I have a large collection with a lot of obscure music) and I can't organize/search by genre. It has good recommendations. Its really bad for people who have large, organized music collections and great for people who want new music..but I can't buy the songs, organize the new ones how I want, or add them into my main collection.

So I've given up on all the cloud services and am just going to use files. I can spend $120 a year on real music I own. I would love for a cloud service to work for me, or to just not care enough to be able to use one.

"I'm disappointed because I thought Apple Music was going unify the listening experience of professional and indie music, but it's still gated.While I was watching the Keynote, the music industry guy who got up, showed a slide with all these different music services and was talking about how our music listening experience was fragmented. I liked that because I've long had the frustrating experience of going to Spotify or iTunes to listen to commercially produced music, and then having to switch to something else like SoundCloud or BandCamp to listen to friend's and local band's music.

It's always seemed stupid to me. Now that we're all digital, it doesn't make sense that the library is gated. Why do artists have to go through a third party to put their music on iTunes? While it probably generally raises the bar for quality, it just doesn't make sense anymore. And, with millions of users liking and adding songs to playlists, the question of quality should be solvable with algorithms.

So, when Apple Music was announced, and the music industry guy got up there, I interpreted what he was saying as Apple Music opening that gate so that professionals and amateurs alike could have their music found and enjoyed all in the same experience. I was excited. Now I'm bummed out. Frankly, I don't so much care about the 'social media' efforts of big bands--connect--I care about the social media efforts of the nothing-band. I like hearing new music, but I don't like that someone else still has to 'discover' the next unknown thing for me. I want to be able to do it myself.

So can anyone explain it? Why is the library still gated? Why doesn't Apple Music allow anyone and everyone to add their songs and present their projects on Connect?",0,0,1559.5383344892716

I used to be a Google Play Music user about more than a year ago. But I'm someone who installs a lot of custom ROMs, and I even keep experimenting on my PC with all kinds of Linux distros. So Google's stupidly strict deauthorization policies caused a lot of problems.

Then I switched to Apple Music because Spotify or YouTube Music wasn't then available in India. I had heard so much about Spotify I was just waiting out for it but boy was it a disappointment. Not only is the UI crappy but they didn't have any Ed Sheeran songs in India. Then came YouTube Music and in the usual Google fashion, they had no clue what to do with it. They still don't and it has a bug that won't let me download songs.

"I want to pay for a Spotify premium account but...I won't. 

I'm sharing this with you guys because I want to see if some Spotify employee can ""hear"" me here. 

This is my complain:

I've got my month's trial premium a year ago (or even more) and I paid for next months too, then as I had an iPod in that days (no data plan, so no fun) I've unsubscribed of the service, but there was a problem where Spotify charged me another month, I got mad and used PayPal's features to ask a refund, which was granted. 

Till now all seems good right? But isn't cause I've never expected that Spotify would banned me for that reason... Never crossed my mind to stop using Spotify's services... Just wanted a little time until I got a gadget to properly enjoy the streaming outside BUT THEY JUST BANNED ME! My playlist are there and I don't have access to them, indeed I thought I couldn't use the service anymore with that email (my personal email), I figured out a workaround, I could log in using my Facebook's account but I dislike using Facebook as a tool to log in into my accounts... Being I the client of that service and showing my unconformity I went to Spotify help menu and asked for a ticket and explained my complain but today there are no responses about it and I don't see a reason why should I being forced using my Facebook account or another email to enjoy the service and cannot log in anymore using my email just because I've asked a refund with PayPal... 

I like the service and nowadays I have no complains to get a couple months, but I prefer to use my old account (email one) and in order to don't lose my new playlist in the Facebook one a workaround to keep both alive because if they are able to give me back my old account I wouldn't like that tracks fade away... Again. 

TL;DR: In the past I had a couple problems with the service so I asked a refund with PayPal, then Spotify denied me to log in with that account, as a workaround I can log in using my Facebook account (or another email) but I dislike that options, I've showed my complains with the company but never care about it, I keep using the service and I like it more than before, but in order to get a premium account i would like to keep both accounts (because of the playlists).

"I tried & I failedGave Apple Music a go for 10 + months. Hadn't created a new playlist during my time with it and only added about 20 songs to existing old existing playlists that i had migrated from Spotify using STAMP.  I became more and more annoyed with my habit of isolating myself to the same few playlists, eventually I started using YouTube to listen to music instead of the service I was paying for.... \*sigh\*. Realized i had done goofed myself.

&#x200B;

What had happened to my music habit....

&#x200B;

My old Spotify library consists of more than 40 playlists that i made myself, with more than 10k songs divided amongst them. I used to quite enjoy my music sessions while programming. Often i would use the radio functionality to discover new music in genres i liked, add em to playlists and kept following that white rabbit for days on end, expanding my musical horizons. My playlists became more and more refined allowing me to discover great new music at the press of a button.

&#x200B;

Tried using the @love functionality, tried the suggestions apple music came with. It was so bad, even with all my Spotify music merged into the library from the get go. I might've used the app incorrectly aka. ""holding the phone wrong"".

&#x200B;

Now I'm back on Spotify for the first time in 10 months, its only been a couple hours. Found at least 5 new songs that are playlist worthy. It just works, straight of the bat listening to new songs, enjoying myself again. UI so intuitive, radio functionality much wow, Linux client, web player.... Do i need to keep going?

"I see the Drake takeover as advertisement and changing my app experience. Spotify sees it as a reason to cancel my account.On mobile, I hope these screenshots get through and I linked this all correctly. Not a usual poster to reddit. Anyway....

I emailed about the drake takeover, spotify didn't really address the issue. I'm a premium member who pays for no advertisements and a certain app experience. That's not what I received. I wanted the issue addressed. 

I emailed back and said these stock answers aren't really working, I feel like I should be credited a week or month to my account. 

They emailed back and so kindly offered to cancel my subscription for me. 
Thanks spotify.

There's a reason I choose your service every month and have for probably 5 years now. 
But you gave me enough reason to want to cancel my subscription and switch platforms. 

I guess the days of continued customer satisfaction are over. 
I guess I'm just another number.

"I really really want to enjoy using Apple MusicBut right now I can't. It feels like a half assed attempt by Apple honestly. Spotify beats it in almost anything. From things as basic as not even warning you when you're adding a duplicate song to a playlist up to things like not really having competition with Discover Weekly and Release Radar. I wish I could justify subscribing to AM since it's the same price as Spotify but the jarring user experience makes it not worth it. The Windows and Mac versions of iTunes are clunky and annoying to use and it doesn't even have Handoff integration - Spotify Connect can control devices across the world and yet iTunes and Apple Music can't control devices in the same room! It feels like Apple really doesn't put as much effort in to things as they should. iCloud.com hasn't seen an update in years either - surely that would be the perfect place for an Apple Music web player! And yet the users *themselves* have to code a web interface for something instead of the company doing it. For the amount of money we spend on Apple products (I'm not just blindly hating on Apple from the outside, I have an iPhone, a Watch and a MacBook), the ecosystem feels less and less worth it with every new product release where older products (e.g. iCloud.com and Apple Music) aren't given any TLC.

"I made the switch to Spotify a few months ago and now I'm thinking about switching back.I had been using Apple Music ever since it came out to listen to music because it was already on my phone and it seemed to do the trick. A few months ago, some of my friends convinced me to make the switch saying that it was better to share playlists and find new music, both of which I was very intrigued by, so I decided to make the switch. At first it seemed great, sharing playlists, finding new music, being able to fade into new songs (love this feature), etc. But then things changed.

&#x200B;

The more I used the app the more problems I discovered and I started to becoming more and more frustrated. What problems am I talking about? Well here are just a few that I personally have noticed:

* **There are no full lyrics of songs.** Yes I know everyone says this and it's ""pending,"" but like honestly, who cares about ""Behind the Lyrics""? I, and so many other people, so much rather have the lyrics right there in front of them, and NOT only displaying as they are sung, but a tab where you can view them.
* **You can't see all of an artist's songs.** What I mean by this is when you click on an artist, there is no ""show all songs"" button to see all of there songs. Preferably there would be with a filter that you can sort them by release date, popularity, most plays, or something. Yes, I know you can search the artist's name up and then click ""See all songs"" but that is not all songs of the artist but all songs from your specific search, two very different things.
* **The recent searches feature just flat-out sucks.** So you would think that any of your past searches would pop up, but no...only if you select the search. Like I want to see my recent SEARCHES, but just recent selections. On top of that, if one of my recently searched songs is on the list I CAN'T FREAKING PLAY IT JUST BY CLICKING ON IT. This is beyond frustrating. Instead, it brings me to a page about the album it's in and other useless info.

&#x200B;

These are just a few of my frustrations with Spotify that are making me want to make the switch back to Apple Music, especially seeing that Apple just added the search by lyrics option and Spotify can't even display the song ""Don't Lose Control"" when I search ""Dont Lose Control."" Like honestly.

&#x200B;

What I'm really wondering here is why do you stand by Spotify and continue to use it. I'm not saying you are dumb for using Spotify in any sense, I just genuinely want to know.

"I just responded to /u/quat1e ‘s question regarding Spotify & AM. Turned into one hell of a rant and I thought I’d come to the community to see if it’s user error more so than AM shortcomings.Below is my response to u/quat1e ‘s question. I’ve edited this answer shortly so it makes a bit more sense.

If anyone has any suggestions please let me know - I really wanna make AM work but rn I’m pretty frustrated and disappointed. I haven’t even gotten to music suggestions yet.


I’m 1 day into Apple Music after 2+ years of daily use on Spotify.

I expected some teething problems but honestly not the ones I’ve had.

Just to give a quick 101 of the biggest things I’ve noticed (again 1 day in so perhaps I’ll find a work around)

1.	No way to easily (if at all) ‘Follow’ an artist - so in situations where you find an artist you like or find an artist you’d like to explore more later but you aren’t 100% committed to their music being apart of your offline library yet? Yeah no way of putting artists in that space on AM
2.	The initial Artist/Genre Preferences - the AM process is hideous, balls that you leave small for don’t mind don’t hate, tap once the ball grows for Like, tap again ball grows again for Love. However, if you don’t like an artist you have to tap and hold for 3 fkn seconds. So when AM sends you 10 bubbles with 4 artists you like it takes a long fkn time to remove the other 6 you don’t. I ended up skipping this process just out of sheer frustration.
3.	You’re unable to easily (if at all) reset your preferences after you crack it and skip artist/genre selection process. Fml
4.	When you play an Album of a band on Spotify if you have the ~online radio~ feature on (I think) once you’ve finished that album by that particular band it’ll go on and play bands/songs with a similar sound/genre. This is a big no no from AM. It’ll just play the album then stop.
5.	The artist radio function on AM is just artists’ songs not a collection of music by different artists.
6.	This is more of an Apple Watch X Apple Music X iPhone frustration; There is no way to turn on shuffle from the ‘now playing screen’ (iPhone Or Apple Watch) - so you want to play one of your playlists, you’ve selected it from your Watch and it’ll start playing the playlist from the top. No worries (it’ll play from the top on Spotify too and you need to phone to shuffle)  just head over to my iPhone ‘now playing xyz by zyx’ okay no shuffle button from this screen - drop down now playing you’re now in some random arabic band that your travels took you to 3 hours ago. Back back back back ah scroll scroll scroll ah alas my playlist - I’m really enjoying this song I’m now halfway through it would be a shame if you had to hit shuffle and just start another song in the playlist right now! - AM lol

Yeah so 24 hours of Apple Music this is where I’m at, I made the switch for 2 reasons - Apple Watch & Family Sharing as we have 4 of us paying for streaming services.

I’m not a coder or programmer by any means but I’m certainly not tech illiterate and if these features are available they aren’t readily available . I’ve even conducted several google searches for what I’d imagine to be ‘simple functions’ and still nothing.


But honestly if I don’t see/find improvements in the short term then yeah I’ll probs go back.",0,3,250.59162152577602

"I chose Apple Music instead of Spotify today and here's why I've  had Spotify since 2016 and been using it up until today when I've found  out that a beta version of Apple Music web player is out.

Now,  Spotify offers a great service and the key factor for me is that you  can play it on different devices and use your iPhone as a remote control  for it if you play Spotify through a Mac or a PC.

Also, most of the people I know use Spotify, so seeing what they are listening to is fun and it helps to find new songs.

The search on Spotify, when you write and the results appear instantly is really good, hard to beat that.

BUT!

Apple  is not a conventional company that would go along with the crowd, and I  am talking from a long-term business model perspective. Let me explain -  Apple does not offer a free Apple Music tier; iOS, macOS, watchOS and  everything else is not open source; the phones and computers do not  offer such  customization level as Android or PC might (although it  depends from where you look at it); and the list could go on, but the  basic idea here is that Apple understands the basic model of how America  works and on what foundation was it built on - **there is a price for everything**.

Spotify  does earn money from ads, but most of the money comes from Premium  users and most of the users in free tier are from Europe, while the U.S.  market chose Apple Music, because paying money for a quality service  means that the artists and the developers of the service will continue  making the service even better and artists will continue making great  music. And also, I can still use Spotify for free, while paying my share  to the great people behind Apple and the whole ecosystem.

The  fact that we, Apple users, trust Apple with our privacy, with their  decisions on how the operating system should look like, feel like, what  services are being offered to us and how much the continuity across the  devices brings us joy - that is why we love this company and I do  believe that in the future, in the long run, in the infinite game Apple  will crush everyone.

**tl;dr - The web player of Apple Music helped me to switch; In the long term I think Apple's services will boom.**

"I can barely stand Spotify anymoreRight now, the only thing still positive about spotify is the ease of adding individual songs to playlists, and that they haven’t yet removed the feature of importing local songs (but even that is fucked sometimes, not loading my PC’s music folder). 

I’ve paid for the service for 2 years, and had an account since the start as one of the first invitational accounts, meaning I used it free without ads until they changed the policy. But with the update early this year that changed the whole UI to some god forsaken hipster mobile appearance and dumbed down almost all useful features (double-clicking a playlist to play random song from it no longer works), I’m not sure I want to continue supporting this once legendary application from my motherland.

They removed third-party apps, the Spotify client for Windows is horrendously slow, even when it’s been open and playing for hours (if minimized it takes 5-10 seconds to go fullscreen), the mobile app is so counter-intuitive I want to scream when trying to get to my playlists, and playlist sorting is not what it used to be. They removed starring songs too. There’s way too much empty space, and you can’t even resize columns of playlists (Song Title, Artist, Album, Duration, and Date Added) anymore. 

In June they changed the warm green color of most elements to a puke-y neon green. Since then I’ve been struggling to really like it.

* the curated playlists.
* the ability to ""heart"" a song or album.
* the depth of the catalog they had for a particular artists.

* replacing songs that I have placed on my songs with different versions of the song.  I want to have the original version of the song rather than the ""rerecorded"" version, thank you!
* in ability to easily access the songs/albums that I have ""hearted"".

"I broke Spotify on accident, and I hope it never fixes.
(Spotify didn't break, my aux cord didn't work)

For some reason, I turned on Spotify and now every song is being played weird. Realllllly weird. In fact, what I've narrowed it down to is only recorded instruments and vocals are being played by ALL songs. No mastering or bloops or bleeps

It's so satisfying, and I can even hear things not normally present in the songs like breathing. Can this be feature, please?

It sounds like I'm in the recording studio, and the vocals are muffled only by the glass.

***edit*** 

I was chilling playing games as I made these notes. On further inspection, the greatest impact is definitely the vocals. In general, they are far more laid back, and their volume takes a definite back row to the instrumentals. Still testing some songs and will report a few samples later.

***solution*** 

As some users stated, the issue was in fact the Aux cord. Apparently the one I used must be plugged in half way to play music correctly. Toying with it I found that slightly loose lowered vocals while slightly too far lowered instrumentals. Either way, I like this new nifty trick. I still enjoy it very much. If samples are still requested just Pm me.

***final observation***

So,thing about my setup, and how my aux cord sits causes certain tracks in the mix ( of a single song) to be harshly silenced or muted, and caused others to be more pronounced. ",1,20,640.2886305603026

And how do you rate songs? It seems like you either HAVE the song in your library or you don't. I'm not a streamer person, I don't have the luxury of unlimited data, I need to download my music to my device, and I tried to download and it took forever to download one song. And why did the cute fav heart change to a 'save' or 'follow'  when I started the free trial? That is so not-cute. This user interface should be the same no matter if you are free or premium. I -liked- the hearts. Now its really small ugly text to add music.

This whole app is just bad, I don't know why its higher rated than others. I have yet to find an artist on spotify that I can't on Google Play, and Google has all the mature rated uncensored version of some of my favorite albums that Spotify does -not-. There's no easy way to tell either if an album is explicit language or not.  I don't need censorship.

"How to get more female artists in Spotify-suggested playlists?I was listening to my Liked Songs the other day (which is primarily songs from my Discover Weekly) and noticed that a lot of the songs were by male artists. Upon realizing this I made it a point for the next two weeks to intentionally seek out and listen to female artists. I thought maybe I could tip the algorithm in favor of suggesting more female artists. No such luck. My Discover Playlist this week included ONE female artist. There were FOUR bands that included at least one female member. The other 25 songs were by male artists or all male bands. Today I logged on and Spotify had a list of suggested albums for me. Of these there were ZERO female artists, ONE band that included a female member, and the other NINE albums were by males artists or all male bands. In the radio playlist for a female singer/songwriter, only 43% were by female artists. 
 
I know this sexism has been written about previously, not just for individual suggestions but in global top lists as well: https://thebaffler.com/latest/discover-weakly-pelly

I guess my questions are:
1) Why is there not an equalizer algorithm embedded in Spotify? This would provide equal representation of male/female artists to all listeners, not just the ones who noticed their Spotify is sexist and downloaded a separate app. 
2) Is there any way to tip your personal algorithms in favor of recommending more female artists?

My biggest grip right now is that I live in France, and the generated Apple playlists (eg. Office DJ, New Music Daily, ...) all contain weird French songs and I’m not a huge fan of them.

Is there a way to change my region to somewhere else like the US so I only get American songs?

Additionally, is there a way to access playlists from other countries? In Spotify, there is one ""New Music Friday"" playlist per country and you can check out each of them, a feature like this would be great on Apple Music.

"How can Apple Music be so bad?I've been a developer for a very long time. I understand software. I've also been an Apple fan and Mac user for a very long time. I understand Apple. But I don't understand how they released a piece of software that is so broken and even after a long time and several updates continues to be fundamentally broken.

I tried it out when it first came out and it was pretty rough around the edges but I put up with it because it was rev 1. Decided not to sign up. I just signed up again today and played with it for an hour or so on my iPad Air 2 and am simply in a state of disbelief that it's this bad. 

I tap an artist I like and many times I get a blank page. Totally white, maybe with a Follow button. Sometimes I get some of their albums, but for some artists not all of the ones I know are available. I tap an album, hit Add to Playlist, New, and sometimes the tracks are all blank. No titles, no art. Sometimes they're ok and I have to type the album title and hit Done. Go back to Playlists and hit Apple Music Playlists and the list is empty. Kill the app, repeat, same thing. 

Hitting hearts often does nothing at all, doesn't even light up. Add to My Music and it doesn't show up in the list. The list goes on. What a mess. 

I can't believe they expect us to pay for this. Even though Spotify stupidly doesn't have a family plan in Canada I guess I'll have to use that for more money.

>The benefits of paying your artists more would include having more artists wanting to use Spotify as a platform to share their music and therefore drawing in more customers. Artists would be more happy to suggest Spotify to aspiring artists or where their fans should/could find them. Artists would be more likely to have Spotify exclusives increasing Spotify's value thereof!

"Help with new update - can't transfer music from my macbook to my iPod.I have a MacBook. I use it mainly to post on reddit and to manage my huge music collection.  I am not a tech savvy person - my wife had to twist my arm to get me to get an ipod and dump my huge space-occupying CD collection.

So a coupe days ago, I got a notification that some updates were ready. I finally got around to updating my computer yesterday. I didn't realize the entire OS was being replaced, including iTunes. If I had known that, I wouldn't have done it.

I've spent an insane amount of time organizing and adding custom artwork to my tracks. Only about half has shown up. There's a ""loading artwork"" message on the lower left, but it's been there overnight and no artwork has appeared since last night. I can't get it to go away, and I'm afraid to go in and replace the art in case it does finally load and updates over it and then I have to do it *again*.

I tried hooking up my iPod to transfer some music I downloaded yesterday. before the update, I had been doing manual transfers, just clicking on the albums I want to move to the iPod and moving them to iPod area on the left. This doesn't work now. I click on the album, move it to the iPod area on the left, and nothing happens. The music won't transfer. This has me angrier than anything else BECAUSE IT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SOFTWARE.

When I hooked my iPod up, iTunes immediately transferred about fifty copies of various playlists I have on my iTunes, multiple copies of each, and multiple copies of playlists that I had once had on my iTunes but deleted months ago. I ejected my iPod, and now I'm a little afraid to hook it back up.  Then I spent twenty minutes deleting all the playlists.

I want to go back to the previous version, which worked fairly well.  I'm realizing I probably not able to do that, at least not with my current level of tech aptitude.  Is there some trick to transferring music now that I'm not aware of?   Can I hook up my iPod without all the crazy playlists showing up again?

Why did they do this to me?  I just finally had everything exactly the way I wanted it.

Also, who to I complain to?",0,7,5.400396444874781

"Help me pals 🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️Whatsup reader of this post,

I used Apple Music for 2 years only because it looks really nice (I know weird reason). However I am really thinking about switching to Spotify because of one main reason. I just don’t understand why the fuck Apple Music has no sort feature for playlists. You can not sort a playlist by “old” or “new”. I have got a playlist with like 500 songs and it sucks to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the playlist just to click on my newest song. Even than it plays in the inverted order the songs were added. This means that if I listen to the newest added song, after it the playlist “ends” and Apple Music will play the very first song of the playlist which is the oldest added song. This is really annoying and I cannot stand this anymore. I even created a workflow/shortcut where you can select a playlist and then it will copy all the songs into a new playlist in inverted order. Thus I can start with the newest added song and the next song will be the second newest song... . But that’s really annoying too and is not a good solution. I looked up everything on the internet, but no one is aware of this problem or doesn’t care (?🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️?). Shouldn’t something like this be a basic feature of a streaming platform?! If anyone of you know how to sort a playlist please tell me. If it is not possible, I’ll quit my subscription.",0,12,151.50929514047448
"Help convince me to love Apple MusicHey folks, so I am trying to switch from Spotify to Apple Music mostly because I really wanna be able to say, 'Hey Siri, play me some James Blake.' 

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just not loving it so far. Some of this just has to do with making the transition, but here's what I don't like. 

&#x200B;

1) there's not an easy way to get from a track to its parent album or artist (that I'm aware of). On spotify it's just 2 clicks. 

2) there's not an easy way (that I know of) to browse through the music I've most recently listen to. I tend to fixate on a handful of albums at a time, so Spotify's 'recently listened' window was clutch. 

3) subjective (I understand this is very anecdotal), Spotify is missing some music that I like! Just for example, the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack is only like half available on AM (mostly missing classical or some weird European tracks), whereas it's totally available on Spotify. That's just one example so I get that it's kind of dumb, AM actually has more tracks than Spotify I understand. Similarly, it was really hard to find a recording by classical composer David Lang that I love. Makes me wonder if AM is worse for classical music??

&#x200B;

Please help convince me to love AM haha. Lots of people enjoy the program. Maybe it just takes some time to make the transition.",0,9,180.15687615907575

"Grrr! I've been having various issues with Spotify for over a month. I'm going to cancel my premium. Has anyone else been having problems too?The most recent issue is the search feature is not working.  Before that it would only give me the spinning green circle of death and not even let me access my downloaded music.  Before that it kept saying I was offline when I clearly was connected and everything other than Spotify was working fine.  Before that it was randomly deleting songs and whole playlists.  Before that when I was still using my iPod touch, it kept spontaneously closing and on my third time my iPods screen was in sleep mode and my iPod never turned back on - so Spotify may or may not been responsible for crashing my iPod and reducing me to a crappy kindle fire because my iPod was two weeks out of warranty. :/

Every time I have an issue I get the same response - Reboot.  It costs me more to redownload my music every time I reboot than I pay for Spotify in the first place!  When I explain this to them and tell them that I don't want to do so unless they have the issues worked out, I'm always rudely told to go somewhere and use free public WiFi.  I live in a really rural part of Cali and its at least 100 miles to free public WiFi!  Shit!  Why can't they just get their shit together?!?!

Where is spotify's ability to listen to the user core?

I'm all ""Yo, I've got my entire library right here"" and it's like ""Nah, unless you stream we won't note you've listened to squat"", so there goes the social aspect.


There's less indexing than your file explorer when it comes to tracks stored on your PC and search defaults to their online library. You literally have to scroll or ctrl+f from the local files tab and click the file to play it, so unless you stream *absolutely everything* it's nowhere near accommodating. It doesn't respect that you'd rather play what you own from your PC. 

Disregarding all that, I can't even sync the metadata (am I blind?) of what I have locally, so it's as if they expect you to start from scratch. 


I'm blown away that Groove Music delivers on this simple base level, and it's being discontinued to Spotify soon anyway (the merge library feature, I thought, would cure my latter issue, but no, does nothing).

I've been burned one time too many at this point. There were so many bugs and problems at the beginning but I fought through them because I love the interface and love what they're trying to accomplish here.

Eventually I had a really solid collection on the go. Then I moved country and changed my region in the iTunes Store. INSTANTLY everything was gone. Now this knocked me over. No warning, no sense. No playlists. No music. Why can't the region conflicted songs just not play?? I've been told that if I change my region back again it'll all return. Do I really want to spend ANOTHER month in a foreign iTunes Store so I can access my playlists??

But I digress. I brushed this off. I stayed off Apple Music for a couple weeks and I thought I was finally ready to come back, bruised and battered. Ready to start anew.

Now I've been back with it for about an hour. But... can someone please explain WHY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD when I do a search for New Order, then hit New Order under 'Artists' does it take me to a FRICKIN BLANK PAGE???

AM adds an “album” for every single I save so just saving full albums to my library to listen to later doesn’t help me find them easily. They just get lost in the shuffle. 

My current work around is adding a new playlist for every album I want to listen to or adding a bunch of albums to a single playlist but that feels clunky and muddles up my playlists.

I try to listen to lots and lots of music, and back when the feature was included in Spotify I'd 'star' maybe 2 or 3 songs from each album which a) helped me make a killer playlist and b) help me seek out (visually) my favorite tracks of artists/albums I don't really know that well.

Following artist on Apple MusicMy network provider gives me free data usage for AM so I subscribed to their 3 months trial. All is well but can you follow an artist like you can do with Spotify. Only way I can see you can do it is to add a song or album to my library and and it shows on the Artist tab. I’m I missing something?.,0,5,31.186646451006336
"Following a Daily Mix... what happens when they update?I recently noticed you could follow your Daily Mixes and they show up in your library as playlists. It looks like as songs update in the Daily Mix they also update in your library, so this seems sort of like a shortcut to that mix. 

Just wondering if anybody knows what happens when a followed Daily Mix is changed significantly... sometimes my listening habits change and I ""lose"" a genre for a while. I was hoping following the Daily Mixes might fix this, but if the songs are updating in a followed mix I'm worried it won't help that problem at all.

Spotify [says](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/made-for-you-playlists/) ""Select 'heart' on a playlist to save it. This means you can always find it in Your Library, under Playlists and it will continue to update there."" (I'm assuming they mean ""follow"" not the heart icon.)

Anybody insights?",1,0,2.4067922199324325

"Fastest way to add a band's discography to library?Hello folks.

While I'm so fucking glad that Apple Music has no such limit (afaik), I'm finding it really cumbersome to add all the music I like to it. Specifically, I like to add the entire discography of a given band I listen to, EPs and all, and I really don't like havin to go through each album on iTunes, which takes a long time to load, to hit that + button.

"FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO SYNC/DOWNLOAD LOCAL FILES FROM MY MACBOOK PRO TO MY IPHONE 6S SO THEY ARE AVAILABLE OFFLINEI've seen many threads that contain bits and pieces of the solution, but here is what I did. Ignore the whole uninstall/reinstall/firewall bullshit. At least I've been through all that to no avail. Here's how I got this solved:
 

**ON YOUR MACBOOK:**
So you have your local files that appear on Spotify. Make a new playlist and call it ""Local Files"". Drag all the songs (or whichever songs you want synced to your iPhone) from the original Local Files on the Spotify sidebar, to your new Local Files playlist.


**ON YOUR iPHONE**
You will see the new ""Local Files"" playlist appear. You click download, but the songs are not syncing when you try to download the playlist. The playlist is either ""waiting to download"" or ""waiting for wifi"" and most of the songs are greyed out (minus the tracks that Spotify found in its own database--those may be downloaded.) However, keep the playlist switched to Download.


**HERE'S THE FIRST STEP THAT MOST ""SOLUTIONS"" ARE MISSING:** On your iPhone Spotify app, click ""Your Library"" in the bottom right corner. Now on the top right, click the Settings icon. From there, click on ""Streaming Quality"". Scroll to the bottom and you will see **""DOWNLOAD USING CELLULAR""**, meaning you will be able to download songs over 3G/4G/LTE. **MAKE SURE THAT IS TURNED ON**. After it is turned on, go back to Your Library, and exit the app.


Create a personal hotspot from your iPhone. Settings -> Personal Hotspot. Turn that on, and join that hotspot on your computer under the WiFi icon on the top bar. Keep Spotify open on your desktop. Open Spotify back up on your iPhone.


Go to playlists on your iPhone. If you haven't yet, download your new Local Files playlist. 


**This, at least in my situation, magically cured this issue. All of the files now started downloading on my iPhone.**


After success, be sure to turn off the ""download using cellular"" unless you don't mind Spotify downloading music when you're not on wifi. 


Let me know if this worked for you! ",1,2,1038.849463891147

To use it, you simply install the update and ask Siri to play a track ""with Spotify."" The new integration also works with CarPlay, giving you hands-free control over Spotify tunes while you drive.

Spotify was able to use Siri thanks to the third-party audio integration [now included](https://crazygadgetshere.com/expected-ios-13-siri-support-for-spotify) in SiriKit as part of iOS 13.

Before, we would get big headline sized recommendations for Saturday or Friday night playlists, along with other playlists Apple thought we would most like to hear that day.

One more thing: I wish that we had our own personal radio station (like YouTube Music has) that would continually play music we like and music Apple thinks we would want to hear.

I put on ambient digital music that's not very loud but not super quiet either.  However as soon as the commercials come on its like the volume got turned up to the max setting, its really really annoying.  

For a while I thought about upgrading my account just so I could get rid of them, but thats like negotiating with terrorists. So instead I've made it into a game to see how quickly I can mute the commercials and get back to my work before unmuteing it again a minute or two later.  It seems like Spotify likes to play this game too because they like to unmute it sometimes so they can blast commercials at me anyway.  

The sad part is that I would gladly listen or watch their commercials if they didn't try to blow out my ear drums in the process.  I work in advertising and I like keeping up with new campaigns and see what some of the national brands are up to.  

If you work at Spotify can you please try to fix this?  I like the service and would consider upgrading in the future, but right now I just don't like you enough to give you my money.

"Does Apple Music give you an option to view your personal play counts?I’m thinking about switching to Apple Music from Spotify since Spotify doesn’t give you an option to view personal play counts. I’ve been on Spotify for 7 years and I wanna go back and see how many times I’ve played a certain song, I’ve even asked the developers to implement the option, but they said “not right now.”

"Does Anyone on here use both Apple Music and Spotify?For the past month and a half, I've been super torn trying to pick between the two services, so I've decided I am just going to use both. My reasoning for using both is that I love a lot of things about both services. 

&#x200B;

Spotify's music discovery and playlists are great. I have discovered so much new music and artists via their playlists and personal playlists such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar. But I don't really like their UI and library management, plus no lyrics, and that's where Apple Music shines for me. It seems like every update, Spotify removes features and never adds anything. Like, Spotify used to have lyrics for example and removed them 3 years ago, promising they'd return shortly but never have.

Spotify has just left a bad taste in my mouth in terms of their insistence to remove features and make their UI worse with each update.

&#x200B;

Apple Music's UI is so clean and organized and Apple respects your music as your personal music library. There's no 10,000 song limit, there's music videos/genres, amazing lyrics feature, light and dark mode, ability to upload your own music, etc. If Apple Music had comparable playlists and discovery features, then Apple Music would be 100% a winner for me.

So what I do is I use Spotify to discover music and browse their playlists, then I transfer these playlists and all of the new music I discover on there over to Apple Music via SongShift, which has always worked wonderfully for me.

"Do you want a silly way to listen to music?Go on Spotify. Select an artist and try to be random about it. Look at all of his/her/band's songs and pick one track. The track is about a theme that you choose. It could be ""weird"", ""lonesome"", ""happy"", ""stupid"", ""cheerful"", ""heartbreak"", ""carpe diem"", or whatever. After you play the song, go to the page of one of his/her/band's ""related artists"". Do the same - listen to one track. Next, choose one of that person's (or band's) ""related artists"" and listen to another song. 

This is a good way to listen to obscure tracks that were not presented on radio. As for myself, I found a wild John Denver cover of The Ink Spots (a creepy R&B band from the 40s).

"Dear Spotify: here's why I'm leavingNot sure if I'm in the right subreddit for this, but I've got some gripes that I want to mention publicly in addition to direct feedback.

I've used Spotify for about 2-3 years, and I joined because I noticed that Pandora, my previous music source, lacked a lot of less popular artists. Spotify has been pretty good in terms of music availability. I also love the ""Discover Weekly"" and ""New Release Radar"" playlists, where I find a lot of my new music.

I guess the first complaint I'll mention is the one that pushed me over the edge to switch to Google Play Music. My library got full. I wanted to save an album, and got [this](https://i.imgur.com/BNJAvOb.jpg) message. I'm sorry, Spotify, but I'm paying you for a cloud service, and it doesn't really make sense to limit my library size... how much more infrastructure does it take to store a bigger master playlist?

The app is sometimes infuriatingly slow. From a cold start, sometimes it will take over 30 seconds to get music playing. Searches are the same way. This laggy behavior can happen on good or bad internet connections. It's not every time I search or start the app, but it is consistent enough that I've gotten used to it as an expected inconvenience. I've experienced this on all my phones, from a Galaxy s3 to a OnePlus 3t.

The Chromecast (1st gen) support is laughable, and obviously an afterthought. First off, the Chromecast app is in PORTRAIT orientation, letterboxed into the TV. It looks kind of like a port from the android app. Second, the play/pause icon on the TV shows the opposite state of the one in the app (if the music is paused, the TV shows the pause button, while the phone shows the play button). The whole thing is very laggy, and sometimes doesn't even load successfully (as in, no, you cannot play Spotify music on the Chromecast today)

Dear Spotify, we are paying for a music service which should be simple: lots of music, interesting playlists, offline listening, and easy to access on multiple platforms. You meet the first 3 fine, but it seems like you don't even have a team to test Android usability. If you put a dev/test team on the android app, you would quickly find the shortcomings of its usability.

"Dear Spotify, can you do something about your customer service. (AN OPEN LETTER)Hi Spotify, it's J3ffr3y.

I'd like to reopen my premium account with you, but honestly,  I'm just a little concerned about the lack of contact methods you have in place.   It took me well over a month to cancel a fraudulent account charged to my other credit card via email when it could have been handled in minutes over the phone.  When I contacted my credit card company, due to a lack of response on your part,  they gave me your phone number.  Which, when dialed, directed me back to your email address.  Not to be an asshole, but what sort of measures are in place to ensure i don't have this very same experience again?  I really do like your service but as an already disenfranchised individual user I feel neglected.... I'd kinda like to feel warm and fuzzy about all of this but, alas, i do not. I really don't require much.... maybe you can speak to Juanes ♫ and possibly guarantee a response within 24hrs by email.... or something.  I mean, there has gotta be at least 3 of you working there, right? 


Please do something, I really wanna buy back in.



Your friend,

"Dear Spotify .. an open letter,Dear Spotify, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I'm sure that your developers must be feeling sore right now.

So, a couple of suggestions to take the heat away ...

How about issuing user-friendly '**Release Notes**'  to the users email address in conjunction with with every update, so we know what we are in for in terms of the changes being made?

And, how about allowing users to have an option to create '**Restore Points**' or some other mechanism so that we can roll back to a previously loved version of the app?

I know it all sounds very old school but your current approach is alienating and dis-empowering so many users.

"Current Android beta improves this app a tonAfter almost being available for 4 years on Android, I can finally say that Apple Music is FINALLY functioning in a much better state on this platform. Until this 3.0 beta began, it was, frankly, garbage on Android, IMO. I’ve been using it on and off, ever since it became available for Android, and it was usually a terrible experience. Album art wouldn’t load or would only partially load, music would stop streaming mid-song, lots of buffering would occur, changes made to playlists would often not sync, music you selected to download would refuse to do so, song ratings wouldn't sync, etc. Seriously, it was a terrible, frustrating, buggy mess that Apple should be thoroughly ashamed of.

But now, things are really different and much better (at least in my experience over the last week). I don’t know what’s caused it but I sincerely hope that it sticks, because the 3.0 beta version of the Android app performs so much better that it’s practically a night and day difference. So major kudos to whomever at Apple is responsible for this! You’ve done a helluva job with improving things! :)

Not to say things are perfect, mind you. There are still issues, like:

1) Album art for the weekly 3 personal mixes playlists (Chill, New Music, Favorites) still seem to be finicky and often won’t show. 

2) If you download a playlist, and then later add new songs to it, the new songs won’t automatically download to your phone. You have to go and manually tell the playlist to download again.

3) The UI of the Now Playing screen still sucks (personal opinion). Not having the “add to library”, “love”, “dislike”, “repeat”, and “shuffle” buttons here really makes interacting with the app a clunky experience. It makes me have to go and press multiple buttons and jump through multiple screens, to be able to perform functions that I use repeatedly throughout the day. It’s just not a pleasing experience here since it causes too much work to do things that should be simple and effortless. 

But aside from that, I’m much happier with the performance and reliability this app now has on Android. (Just, PLEASE, Apple, give us the options to have the icons I mentioned above on the Now Playing screen, I beg you! This will make using the app a much more positive experience). 

Oh, also — I absolutely love the personal radio station even more than I already did before this beta. In fact this is one of the few features that Apple Music offers that Spotify does not, and makes me prefer Apple Music over Spotify. While Spotify gives you multiple personalized radio stations, separated by genre, I prefer Apple’s approach with there being one personal station that plays all the different types of music you like, while also throwing in new tunes that it thinks you might enjoy. I’m not sure what exactly has caused this station to improve of late (if it’s the beta or the fact that I’ve been going through my entire library and liberally “liking” and “disliking” every single one of the almost-3000 songs in it), but this station has been incredible for me over the last week. It’s given me lots of new songs I’d never heard before, and that I’ve now added to my library.

Anyway, if you’re on Android, and had given up on Apple Music (like I had), try to get in the beta and give it another shot. I really think things have vastly improved, and hope they continue to do so!  

(FYI, this is all based on using the 3.0.0 version of the beta, released on August 27th, and used on an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S10e phone).",0,15,42.123722765718895

"Confused by this subredditHey all - 

I've been a spotify users for a few years, and I would estimate that I use it at least 2-3 hours every day.  I was hoping to find a Spotify subreddit inside of which Spotify users would share tips and tricks, or stories about how they use Spotify based on their own listening goals.

What I found instead is a sub that, as far as I can tell, has posts of two varieties.

1. Ridiculously overdramatic panicked posts about some feature change, followed by a rant about how Spotify did something that interrupted your VERY SPECIFIC way that you use Spotify, followed by a threat to LEAVE FOR APPLE MUSIC.  
2. Curated Playlists...which seem an odd choice for a Spotify subreddit.  Why not in a music subreddit?

As a child of the 80s that spent a FORTUNE on Tapes and CDs, I can assure you there has never been a greater musical value for less money than Spotify.  And yet the members of this sub lose their shit regularly when Spotify dares to move your cheese...never mind the fact that they may be making choices that serve a longer strategy that you are unaware of.  It's like $10 (and less for students) for essentially almost all of the music you'll ever need.

Out of curiosity...does a sub like the one I described exist?  One in which people share Spotify tips and discuss possible future features and integrations?",1,3,14.223827316932105

"Comparing Spotify With Apple MusicFuck this update.
Switched to apple a couple weeks ago and theres a lot of things I like better about this app.

In order of most important to least, with apple you can:

- Save individual songs / delete bonus tracks or remixes tacked onto the ends of albums that i don't want to save

- Scroll through my library using an alphabetical scroll bar

- Have access to music i didnt with spotify. Now i can listen to Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and a number of other albums that aren't on spotify

- None of the new bullshit with ""liking"" songs, you can still like songs but its not stupid like how spotify does it.

- Load pages without a 3-10 second loading delay when internet connection is spotty, and my albums dont start randomly fucking disappearing from my library when im not connected well to the internet

- View lyrics to most songs right in the app with the tap of a button

- Select a song to ""play later""(add to queue) but now I can also say ""play next"". Plus to get to the queue you just scroll down instead of tapping something and you can swipe to delete songs from the queue

The bad parts of apple music:

- No dark theme

- Probably not as good as apple at radio type stuff but I never used that anyway so im not the best to ask

Overall apple music is just way faster and more user friendly now than spotify is.

EDIT

The decision really comes down to how you use the app. If you are more interested in receiving music recommendations and listening in a radio/playlist style then spotify is the way to go. If you are interested in a big organized music library of albums then you may want to consider switching to Apple.

"Clearing the air about the new UI
People calm down it's not the end of the world. 


I have been using the new UI since march or April now and here are my thoughts.


Major changes I've noticed


Saved songs -
 now show up as liked songs
No real functional difference here all your songs are still saved your song library is still safe.


Now playing screen -
Its heavier i believe so I'd recommend turning canvas off in the settings saves data and prevents lag.

One good addition is that now playing queue button shows up at the bottom so it's much more accessible then before especially on taller devices.


Now the inconvenient changes.


Artist tab - it shows just the artists you've followed.

Now I've always followed most artist whom I actively follow (have multiple songs by them) but earlier if you saved a song from an artist they would also show up there like all normal offline players.


While it makes sense cause i had way too many artists there earlier so it's easier ti get to favorites now.

BUT it greatly affects 2 things


I. If you're accustomed to browse your music through artists you'll have to spend a good amount of time following the artists.

(I've read in some threads that people uesd artists tab get to the songs they've downloaded from that artist and i have no idea how they did that artist tab has always only showed the most popular songs by that artist and all their albums and singles on my device

Now i don't use artists to navigate my library so I might have never seen this option)


II. It does affect discovery as i would some times check out other music from that artist while going through the artist tab which now is not possible



Albums-
This I agree they've ruined it. Partially saved albums don't show up in the albums tab so most people would probably have <10% of their library here now

And unlike artists you cant just go around and fix this.


Now the fundamental change here is that earlier when you saved an album all the songs were added to your saved songs so some times an album would clutter your Library. ( I love listening to film scores and would save them but then I ended up with over 20-30 songs that I don't want to come up in my regular shuffles so i had to make playlists for that)

Now saved albums aren't linked to liked songs so if you want to listen that album just go to the albums tab.


This no link approach means that your saved songs can't get added to the albums tab and that does create an issue if you primarily use albums for navigation. Something that I used to alot in the beginning.



I'd like to say as hard as this transition is the way to go is make playlists I've been doing that for 2 years and it has some advantages over artist or album based navigation 



But Spotify devs definitely did not think this through and the backlash is more than justified.


Stay strong and don't give up hopefully all of this backlash will make them listen to the community more.


Feel free to list other changes and any mistakes that i might have made in this.

PS I don't think the new UI is any good either. Spotify has never been perfect but we've made it work and now they've literally taken away the methods we used to make that happen. 
And if it really is making your music experience miserable you can download an older version from apkmirror.

"Changing my profile photoHi 

So I've tried googling this so many times and I can never find an answer. I know that to change your profile photo you have to use the laptop app, click on your profile, hover over your profile, and there should be a 'change' option. 

HOWEVER

Last week I was trying a whole bunch of different photos just to see how it would look as my profile photo, I changed it maybe \~10 times. When I would change it, I would need to refresh the app or wait a few minutes for the new photo to be updated on my macbook and on my iphone app. At one point spotify started glitching a little and stopped updating when I changed the photo, and then started randomly going between the previous photos I had tried before. 

Now, it's stuck on this one photo that I don't want. There's no option for me to change the photo- there's no 'Change' when I hover over my profile. It's disappeared. The only button I see is the three dots on the right that allow you to 'share'. 

I've tried deleting the macbook app, redownloading, trying to find ways to change my profile on mobile, web, etc. 

Has anyone had the same problem before, or have I just reached a limit of being able to change my profile? If so how long do I have to wait before it lets me change it again... it would be really dumb if spotify stopped letting me change my profile forever.

"Changing ""Your Songs"" to playlist is actually changing it back to its original stateMost of you probably don't even remember but a while back in 2015 and earlier ""Your Songs"" where actually playlist. Also the hearth we are clicking on to save a song used to be star and thus the playlist was called ""Starred"". Here is very old [screenshot](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/wszluvccoba1mj44kp8d.jpg) from PC client.

What I am trying to say is, that when Spotify got rid of Starred playlist and made its own ""Your Songs"" tab we know today, people were hating it, complaining, asking for changing it back. Four years later their prayers were answered and you know what, people are complaining again. 

Bottom line is you guys will get used to it. And the change is good, it makes sense. You can finally share your saved songs. You can work with them as you can work with any other playlist, and the Spotify offers much more options to do all kind of stuff with playlists. Changing covers, descriptions, sharing them, you can decide whether to make your saved songs public or not, and you can use all third party apps working with playlists (if you don't know about them, [check this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/95ga27/list_of_spotify_stats_websites_and_not_just_stats/), there's ton of them).",1,1,120.72603796465252

"Catalina Music app broke my inline headphone controls functionality, anyone else experience this?I listen to music with Audio-Technica ATH-WS1100iS headphones that have simple and useful inline controls on their mic. One click for pause/play, two clicks for skip, three clicks for go to last track. Works perfectly on Apple Music on Android, and my old iPod Classic, and every version of iTunes, and everything else I've used it on. That is, until, it encountered the new Music app on Catalina. It's the strangest thing: the app seems to automatically add a virtual click to whatever action I've tried to perform. So when I press it once trying to pause, it doesn't skip, but instead simply pauses for a second and then starts to play again. When I press it twice trying to skip, it doesn't go back, it skips two tracks ahead.

"Cannot sync iPhone without disabling iCloud, erasing all Apple music?Ever since Apple Music, I've had this problem. iTunes refuses to sync any local music to my iPhone unless iCloud is disabled on the iPhone.

I have a very bad experience with Apple Music trial subscription now.

To my astonishment I lost immediate access to Apple Music right after cancelation and after reaching out to Apple Support they said no to restore my unused trial period, that's is even after speaking to a Senior Apple Advisor named Gorna over the phone. I acted based on this thread on apple discussions - [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8277618](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8277618.) where it says ' If you cancel during your trial period, you'll continue to have access to the entire Apple Music catalog until the date that you would have been billed for the full price.

"Can I edit genre names?I learned earlier this year - much to my dismay - that Apple was finally gonna kill off iTunes to shift focus to Apple Music. At first I was furious; I am far too accustomed to buying and listening to music on my iPod the old fashioned way. But then I took a closer look, and turns out it doesn’t mean they were gonna shut down the iTunes Store, nor were they gonna take away all the stuff I purchased over the years. They were just gonna move that stuff over to Apple Music. So I decided *maybe* I’ll give their subscription service a try. And as much as it’s gonna kill me inside to have to pay every month for it, when it comes to tracking down the songs/albums I wanna have it could save me a fortune. Haven’t gotten around to it yet, but I am thinking about it.

There’s just one catch, though. Whenever I buy songs from iTunes on my laptop, I usually modify the name of the genre to organize my music a little more neatly before syncing it to my iPod. For example, if I bought a song or album from a-Ha or Tears for Fears, I would change the genre name from “Pop” to “New Wave”. Or if I bought a song or album from Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd, I would change it from “Rock” to “Classic Rock”. I would name more examples based on my tastes, but I think you get the idea.

"Can Apple Music Automatically create a playlist when you only play 1 songIs there any way for Apple Music to create a playlist when you play 1 song, like on Spotify you can search for a song, when you play it, it makes a playlist so when the song is done it goes to the playlist it created, and on Apple Music when the song is over it doesn’t play anything else until you manually search for another song or album.

"CampFire Spotify App - Listen TogetherSo this might not be a Spotify playlist but I think that a lot of people here will appreciate what this app provides.

CampFire lets you create a Room which you can invite anyone into, once inside if a song URI/URL is entered into the chat then the song is played to everyone present in that room at the same time.

It's not an official app yet and is still in development, but hopefully if people show enough interest it'll help me make it official.

"Calling all Playlisters!Hi r/Spotify!

I work for Moledro Digital (http://www.moledrodigital.com), a digital marketing agency based in London. We work with a range of labels, publishing companies and independent artists including Capitol Records (home of Sam Smith, 5 Seconds of Summer and Karen Harding), Fiction Records (home of Kaiser Chiefs), Good Soldier Songs (home of The 1975 and Huntar) and the up and coming independent artists Alyusha and Ebson. 

One of the services we provide is Playlist Plugging. Essentially, we pitch tracks that we’re working on to relevant playlist curators for them to consider adding and to get their thoughts on the track so that we can let the artist/label know how the playlist community is receiving it. Playlisters matter and that’s why we want to hear from you. 

Later this year we are going to be hosting showcase events in the city featuring live performances in unique venues. This will be a great opportunity to introduce playlisters to labels, artists and fellow playlisters all whilst having a good night out.

So, if you own a playlist (big or small) and would be interested in receiving new music, merchandise, gig tickets, job opportunities and/or information about exclusive events for playlisters then please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BjCAKPrC4M4MIGNEKl5trR5Lzni0A9EFgtrVpL8wZi4/viewform). 

Please pass this message on to anyone you think might be interested. If you have any queries about any of the above, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. 

Thanks!

"Bluetooth problems since Android 10Ever since I updated to Android 10 on my Pixel 3 I've had issues with playback over Bluetooth connection. Instead of dipping the volume down for a notification like it used to (although it hasn't done that since I got this phone) it pauses for a second. But now when it resumes after the notification sound it usually fails to output sound to the car. It keeps playing, but no sound over Bluetooth. A quick pause, a two second wait, and pushing play again *usually* solves the problem, but not always. Sometimes I have to force quit the app.
Notifications from Facebook and Lyft Driver apps nearly always do it, but Messenger and Android Messages almost never do. I have battery optimization off already, and I've cleared my cache and updated to the latest version. Amazon Music doesn't have this issue either.

"Bad bad bad experience with Apple Music on AndroidI'm using Apple Music for about 2 months now and since the beginning I just can't like the service because it's terrible on my Android device . App is moving to the next song while it's in a middle of a song , Music is cutting off for 1 second and continues , app is extremely slow . Everything takes 30 sec and more to load . This is the only service that available in my country officially . I wouldn't mind to pay for it . It has great collection to choose from but I'm using the Android app so often that I'm thinking to cancel my subscription (Which is a shame because it's only 5$ in Israel and the only service I can use other than Apple is Deezer which cost 10$ but works better on mobile + it has web player and Chromecast support which is nice to have)
Anyone have this issue and can help ?

"Awful start to Apple MusicI recently decided to test out Apple Music after being with Spotify for almost 4 years because I was really wanting the ability to go on runs with just my AirPods and Apple Watch series 3 and leave the iPhone at home, which if I’m not mistaken, Apple Music is the only streaming service that allows that. After signing up I’ve run into so many problems I can’t see Apple Music being worth it in the long run

1.)  Music won’t sync between my iPhone and MacBook. After allowing the iCloud music library on all my devices my Mac still is unable to receive any of my playlists giving me an error message “genius results couldn’t be updated right now. The network connection was lost” even though the network connection is working fine for everything else

2.) Playlists on my phone won’t download. After importing one of my Spotify playlists I wanted to download it onto my phone but it won’t finish downloading. The download circle sits about 75% finished and that’s it while almost every song has a circle about 95% complete. 

3.) Downloading playlists onto my watch is extremely slow / not working. After almost 15 minutes not even one song has downloaded. If I can’t download songs onto my watch I don’t see the benefits of Apple Music over Spotify. 

Although I want to like Apple Music and fit it into my Apple ecosystem these initial problems plus other functionality features like the inability to organize playlists and an, in my opinion, less clean MacBook app than Spotify makes me want to go back to Spotify. 

If anyone’s experienced / experiencing these issues or why you use Apple Music over Spotify I’d love to hear from you.

"Apple music on android has some serious issues, and generally speaking as well. This has to be knownWell you are probably asking if I dislike apple music so much: why don’t I switch to Spotify or google play music? Because apple music has the best pay plan of all music services afaik ($10 for up to 6 people is insane)

     
And why do I have an android? I had an iPhone for almost 5 years (iPhone 4 and iPhone 5) but I grew tired of the limited storage and exponentially lowering battery capacity. That’s why I switched. So while i was deciding to move I noticed that apple music was just released for android and i was happy because it meant that I won’t have to make my dad pay another 10 dollars for an additional music service, but just then the nightmares began. (This is my list of issues, if you have any let me know so I can send them to apple ASAP)


* **First:** No multi disc album support, (c’mon, even the first iPhone supported this) instead it just shows a scrambled list of songs because the app isn’t designed to show multiple discs.
* **Second:** The app downloads album and artist images every time you enter the ""my music"" tab, wasting internet usage. Just make the app save them in the cache.
* **Third (this is a system wide problem):** Downloading. The downloading of music for offline play just doesn’t feel welcoming in any instance of apple music, even on the mac and iOS. The download tab feels incomplete, we need more info like the total size of the download and how much of it it’s already downloaded, also per song information like you see on iTunes on the desktop, otherwise it feels like it’s doing nothing when in reality it is. Also, like in iOS, we need a way to see if a song is already on the device or not.
* **Fourth:** When notifications arrive it mutes the music instead of lowering the volume. It doesn’t even pause it.
* **Fifth:** Weird cracking when a song ends and some interference from the previously played song when jumping to another (when going to songs not already in the queue)
* **Sixth:** Haptic feedback. I noticed that the whole app is designed in the android aesthetic (and that’s excellent), only one thing is missing, and that is the haptic feedback when tapping on anything.
* **Seventh:** Not being able to go to a previous song outside the app (rly?). in the notifications drop down thing you can see what song is playing and you can pause it or go to the next one, but not the previous one (srsly?). Also scrolling through songs outside the app and even on the lock screen would be a really nice feature.
* **Eighth (Another system wide issue):** library corruption, this has been a major issue ever since apple music was released. Some songs get scrambled and mixed between live versions and album versions or the order is mixed, and this is still happening. And if one device is affected by this iCloud does the wonderful job of spreading the chaos to all your other devices. (It’s not iCloud’s fault as that is what it’s supposed to do, but because of these issues it just becomes a pain in the ass)
* **And finally:** allow us to use external storage to store the cache and downloaded music for offline play. If piracy is your concern might as well encrypt the entire iTunes folder on our computers. Every song is already protected by drm so it doesn’t really matter if they can be extracted as we can already do that on pc and mac and we can’t get through drm anyway. This is one of the main reasons I switched to android (and even if this is done just so we can’t use this feature that’s kind of rude &gt;:c), so please let us take advantage of it.

What do you think of this list? Are there any more issues that i didn't see?",0,18,1393.726690971051

"Apple music is an afterthoughtHonestly this app is a messy glitchy piece of shit. I don’t care how many updates they give to it, it’s been 2 years since this trash launched and you still have bugs that have been in this app and not addressed since day one. I guess since they can get their $10 or however much they you pay for this crap a month, they don’t care. 

Why after ios 11, a slight cosmetic makeover, and the addition of social features am I still getting “Unknown albums” after I delete an album? Why is that album art and title still there undeletable ? Why is the hell is it that when I delete purchased music off of my phone, in the iTunes store when I go to download something, I have to find out for some reason it’s been sent to hidden purchases?

Seriously, for a trillion or how ever much dollar company, Apple sure stumbles on the dumbest shit. Maybe instead of trying to shove a U2 album down people’s throat, you can go an get your fucking team to fix these stupid bugs that no company with the visibility and market hold as Apple, their products shouldn’t even be seeing.

"Apple music behaving quite strange (artwork problems among other things)Ey bbygurls, lemme holla atchu.
First post here. 
Anyway, been loving Apple Music since I first got it, the UI is way more attractive than Spotify, and I do hear a slight difference in sound quality as well (for the better). 
But anyway, I have noticed that sometimes when I add an album into my library, it sometimes skips over songs, and also I had this weird thing where my library completely disappeared when I tried to view an object from the US iTunes Store (to add: i'm not from the US, nor do I live there). and after that it took a couple of hours, then it was back. BUT, a lot of the artwork has disappeared, and even if I delete and re-add them I still don't have the artwork in my library/attached to the music file. I think a nice artwork really heightens the experience of listening to an album, so this is completely bumming me out. Sometimes it seems like the artwork is on iTunes but not in my phone as well. 
I am otherwise pleased with the service overall and it has made me go from sort of being all ""nah I don't wanna stream, I want to have it on my phone as mp3's"". to actually feeling like I can build a library of music and have so much music at hand ALL THE TIME. So that's cool. 
Spotify > Apple Music when it comes to playlists, but if Apple starts bettering themselves on that matter then i for sure am cancelling my spotify subscription instead of having both. 

But yeah, how can I make sure that I actually get the artwork? Having that empty space just drives me nuts. Also one other thing. I have an entire library of my own stuff in iTunes as well, but just ONCE i clicked on a song when I had accidentally unplugged my ext. harddrive, and now all the songs have the exclamation marks before the song title.

"Apple music = disappointing vs. SpotifyI realise that people on here may feel differently or not really care about these features that form the basis of my opinion here, and I welcome that! Please have a civilised discussion on reasons that you may agree/disagree below and please let us know why you like either or another music platform and why!

&#x200B;

So let me begin by saying that I am an Apple music subscriber and was previously a Spotify subscriber before this. I moved to AM when buying an Apple Watch due to the lack of a Spotify Watch app or ability to play music through this device. However, now Spotify is available on the Apple Watch and not only that, provides a better service that Apple Music is, here's why.

&#x200B;

Apple lives and dies by the mantra that when great solutions work best when software and hardware are seamlessly cooperating, creating experiences that the user need not work hard to wield or enjoy. However, with the current Apple Music experience, this is not the case. If like me you own more than one Apple product, then you're probably familiar with this issue. Although if you do not have more than one Apple device then you're probably confused as to what I am referring to, so I will try to explain to the best of my ability. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I have an iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and believe me that I love each device, in its own way, the software and hardware of each work seamlessly. The issue arises when you try to take this experience from one device to another, sure there are ways to enjoy music on all devices but continuing the experience to another of the devices is difficult and ruin the overall experience.

&#x200B;

For example, say that you are listening to a great playlist and you're enjoying this on your iPad, this may be through ear or headphones either plugged in or wirelessly connected. Let us say that you then need to go on the move and you take your iPhone and Apple watch with you. In the car, both your iPhone and Apple Watch can connect via Bluetooth. 

You use your phone and want to continue listening to the same playlist that you were enjoying on your iPad however the music does not continue seamlessly. Instead, you need to locate and either begin the playlist again or trawl through the list to find the song that you were previously enjoying. 

Finally, you go running, something that the Apple Watch is known for and the exercise is tracked well! Unfortunately, you have to take another 10 minutes to set which song you got up to in the playlist and switch your ear/headphones to the Apple Watch, because once more the listening session is not seamlessly continued on the other device. 

You're forced to navigate the confusing multitude of music-related apps on the watch (I believe there are about 3/4) and switch from acting as a remote to the phone to the device playing your playlist. All not easy on a device with a user interface not much bigger than a couple of your fingernails!

&#x200B;

Don't get me started with the iTunes experience on Windows, which has always been gimped when compared to running on Mac.

&#x200B;

When you compare this to the experience on Spotify, whatever you are listening to, on WHATEVER device, you can control and continue listening to on all devices. You can pause, skip and choose another track using your watch while you are listening on your PC. 

Say you need to again go on the move, go into another room, you can continue on your iPad. You need to go running? You can continue on your phone in the car and then the watch, easily switching seamlessly! Without at any time having to trawl through menus or locate tracks, because it is a unified experience compared to the compartmentalised approach that Apple has taken.

&#x200B;

TL:DR Apple's approach to their Music streaming service is not seamless and leads to a bad UX. When compared to Spotify, their service seems archaic and convoluted.

&#x200B;

Do you think that Apple will improve its streaming service to make it a true competitor? Do you think it's already a better service than the competition? Do you use another service altogether? Please discuss below! :D I'm interested to think what you think.",0,18,185.445452547973

"Apple Watch Stopped Displaying the Spotify “Countdown/Counter” On Top Left Corner On The Media Controls Screen, Any Fix?The other day my Apple Watch got stuck in a title on Spotify where it rendered the whole app useless, and i ended up reinstalling it to fix it, but it arose a different small bug/problem, the counter on the top left doesn’t show anymore like it used to over the media controls.

"Apple Music, not quite for me.As most of you, I was so exited to test Apple Music as soon as it came out, but I realised it was not what I though it would be. I'm not gonna write a rant on why I'm ditching out of Apple Music, but instead make some lists with the pro's and cons I accounted.

First of all, I want to make clear I wasn't used to any other streaming music service before. I briefly tried Spotify (but didn't like it), so my opinion is not biased by this. I am mostly and iTunes user.

**Things I liked about Apple Music.**

* Discovering new music: The ""For You"" category in the beginning wasn't very good picking playlists for me but in a short time it developed great playlists with a lot of moods and new music for me to discover. I think this is the function I used/loved the most.

* App design: This one for me is a strong point, since this is the reason why I mostly don't like Spotify, but with Apple Music things are easier to navigate and over all it's a more friendly UX/UI.

**Things I feel neutral about Apple Music or can improve**

* Beats One: The station is fresh, keeps playing new music but also occasionally throws into the mix old good songs. The DJs seems cool and are nice to the ear. But to my taste it plays waaay to much rap music. I think this is a good effort but music is too diverse to match everyone's taste into a single station. I'd love some more rock oriented station and DJ's.

* Music Variety/selection: I find myself listening to a lot of music through SoundCloud or even YouTube, there's some music that I can only listen exclusively on YouTube because I cannot find it anywhere else. I hated Spotify because I could never find most of the songs/artists that I loved and I thought Apple Music would be the solution to this but apparently I have too dark tastes. 

**Things I didn't like about Apple Music.**

* Setting up: When you use the service for the first time, this bubbles with different musical genres pop up and you have to figure out what to do with them. The system is not very intuitive. It took me a little while to figure out how it worked. Also, since I was setting it up from my iPhone (4S) it didn't worked properly, I could accommodate just some bubbles. The musical genres picked up for me were awful. Since I'm in Mexico, Apple must have thought I liked Reggaeton, Spanish Pop Music, Salsa, Ranchera. I don't even have those genres on my playlists or music. When I wanted to add more genres they wouldn't come, or the same one would keep popping over and over. Then on the next step the artists were also so far from what I liked, and It never showed me artists I really liked. This was a very bad first impression.

* Managing music: I use a Mac at work and another at home. I have different mp3 playlists in both. I used to own an iPod Classic where the playlists from my home computer were synced. When I set up Apple Music at my home's Mac it asked me if I wanted to sync my playlists with iCloud, I thought this would be a good idea but it wasn't quite. Sometimes Wi-Fi on my office is quite bad, so when I tried to listen to Apple Music Playlists it would lag terribly or sometimes wouldn't even load (lucky YouTube would work/load just right over the same bad Wi-Fi signal, ha!). Then I wanted to find my original playlists (those I made in the office with mp3) but since all playlists synced it was very hard to find such music within the large library of online music mixed with everything else. I never found a way to choose ""offline music only"" on iTunes, so I had to disconnect my Apple ID entirely from the office iTunes' Mac.

* Apple Music on iPhone 4S: I know I have an old phone but since the service was made available to my device, I should expect it to just work right (Apple was [is?] very good at that). On my iPhone sometimes I wanted to add a song to my library but it wouldn't let me, so I had to make a playlist and then add that song to the playlist in order to make it available offline on my phone. This method sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. When I plugged my phone in the car and wanted to listed to Beats One many times it wouldn't load me the station. Also when plugged sometimes it played some random songs that I listened recently without even making a playlist for it. It took very long to load songs and I felt it like a hot mess.

Finally to summarise it all, maybe streaming music is not quite my thing, I don't know. But I felt the cons were higher than the pro's. Maybe it's the shitty internet connection on my country, or my old Phone. But overall I didn't felt a great benefit from the service. I know this is the first attempt from Apple to make something like this, but I'm used to great quality coming from them. This time it didn't just felt like that.

I think I'll keep discovering music through reddit (there are some great music subreddits, check them out!) and sticking to the good ol' infalible mp3. Until then, I hope Apple Music is really *For You*.",0,0,1508.0767141145136
"Apple Music, iTunes, iTunes MatchSeveral years ago (5ish) I ripped all my CDs to MP3 and eventually imported  into  iTunes.

"Apple Music's sound quality is surprisingly goodMy desktop setup is pretty simple. I have my PC connected to an Audioengine D1 DAC/headphone amp, and that's connected to a pair of Audioengine A2 powered speakers(I've had them for 10 years and they are still going strong). This makes for a decent hi-fi on my desktop.   


I have a large library and lots of it is ALAC from various sources. With the speaker and DAC combination, there's always a wide soundstage and good dynamics from well-recorded music.   


I've been listening to Apple Music on my PC for a while now, and while I can tell the difference between my giant files and the Apple Music stream, it's not a major difference. Some music, especially 70s and 80s arena rock and New Wave, sound fantastic on Apple Music.   


I can honestly say my days of buying physical media and putting them in my iTunes libary are over(as is iTunes, I guess), and I can't see the point in finding high quality rips of things anymore, either.   


I wasn't sold on the whole ""subscribe to listen to music"" thing, but the ability to listen to any song I want, at any time, ANYWHERE, and through voice command, too? Yeah, I'm sold. Apple Music and Carplay are an oustanding combination.

"Apple Music plays different versions of songs from my libraryI tried googling this but I couldn't find anyone with the exact same problem or there weren't any practical solutions. 

Here's the issue

On my desktop in iTunes I have a large music library that I own outright. I've had these songs for years. 

I attach my iPhone to the desktop and download these songs to the phone. But when listening to music through the iPhone Music app, some of the songs are not the same version that I have on my computer. Most often it's the censored version, but most weirdly one song plays just an instrumental version... 

All parental controls on my are turned off and it's very inconsistent. Like, 1 in 30 explicit songs have the wrong version.

"Apple Music on Catalina, a distasterSince I updated my macOS to Catalina, iTunes is gone and it's only Apple Music, which is a good thing. Many parts of it had become irrelevant, so now it's more clear what is what. But man, what were they thinking before releasing this?

\- When I change metadata of a song, it is loading 15-20 seconds. Before it also took long, like 10 seconds, but it has almost been doubled now.

\- I can't press the + button anymore when I'm adding new songs to my library. It doesn't do anything except loading. I have to click on the menu and then click on 'add to library' until something is happening

\- Not all album artworks are squares, but Apple Music has made them all squares, which fucks up a small portion of my library

\- When I change metadata while I have an album opened, it doesn't change with it. So when for instance I change ""Pet Sounds (2019 remaster)"" to ""Pet Sounds"", it keeps stuck on ""Pet Sounds (2019 remaster)"" but there's nothing in it. To go back to the right album, I have to search again which takes me like 20 seconds extra.

\- The search function has become worse then it was

\- Sometimes songs don't play when I double click on the title. I have to wait until the play triangle appears, click on it, and then it plays

\- Sometimes it just starts loading, when I changed nothing at all. For like 10 seconds.

\- They still haven't fixed the fact that you can't search for <artist + title> only by artist or by title. Not both.

\- They still haven't fixed that some tracks have multiple genres.

\- They still haven't fixed a proper way to display featured artist. Spotify is the only app who does this in a good way.

\- I had a collection of music videos, but since not every music video is on Apple Music I added like half of it myself. These are all gone now. I can find them in the Apple TV app, but there's no possibility to return them to Apple Music.

\- Overall it has become a very very slow app. The main reason I use Apple Music is because I can edit metadata and create an ordered and big library. Spotify is super fast. When searching for a song I immediately have it. I really feel bad about the fact that Apple Music becomes worse with every update, because I love its functions so much. The filtered playlists, the countless options on adding and editing metadata.

"Apple Music is very incompetent_**Edit:** I know this is hurtful for iSheeps. And I personally consider myself as one too (that's why I bothered to give it a try even though I've already settled down on Spotify), however, I'm overwhelmingly disappointed by Apple Music shortfalls. By writing this (impartial) review, I believe I'm in a unique position as I've sufficient knowledge of both Apple Music and Spotify. I've also confirmed with Apple customer service pertaining some issues I faced and verify certain facts, as well as seeking for workarounds (support, Internet, myself). It isn't biased since I'm an iSheep that prefers Spotify, so my views are balanced. :P I welcome all valid rebuttals against my points. They aren't for the sake of saying, but will also practically help me and people who encounter similar issues. Thank you!_

As a strong supporter of Apple, I decided to give Apple Music a try. It is also favorable to me to adopt Apple Music as my streaming service of choice due to system's bias. It was very exciting initially despite interface glitches...

Pros:

* integrated into iOS
* known to have exclusive right to stream certain, popular songs on demand
* known for its exclusive content from artistes
* music videos
* more than just music, but podcasts and music-related videos
* diverse option of playlists for everything, of artistes/genres/popularity.
e.g. artiste's favourite, inspired after artiste, etc.
* lyrics available
* designed for social interactions

And this is the real face:

* **the integration is superficial.**
Apple Music in iTunes on Windows is so laggy that it directly ruins my music experience, and difficult to deal with local music that are mixed with existing Apple Music — (""duplicates"")... it's a nightmare. Audio and music videos are treated as completely separated multimedia files. So if you add same song audio+music video in your library and shuffle your entire library, they will be played separately. This will give unfair probability to songs with music video because not all songs have music video.
* **the music videos are just normal videos from YouTube**
there isn't any difference in Apple Music and the iOS. The OS treats the music video as a video. Which means the music will pause when you switch tasks. It won't be recognised by iTunes Match. And quality (visually) is poorer than YouTube's... seems like 480p only. Audio quality I'm not sure, Apple customer service says there's no audible difference. Even so, it doesn't worth since the size is large.
* **you need to sync music with your phone Library to iTunes Library**
I know this isn't a good point. But from a user perspective, one that argues ""Apple Music is more integrated,"" such statement seems to be an oxymoron. It's outright contradiction of reality. I feel that there are 2 separate music libraries with Apple Music (phone&computer) while I never felt that on Spotify. Other than system bias (the Siri), there's nothing else better than Spotify. In fact because of the tedious syncing, it might be considered ""less integrated as compared to Spotify."" I never need to sync my on-demand songs Library with Spotify to update my newly added songs or double delete. Spotify never required me to plug phone to computer/same Wi-Fi network to seamlessly sync my music libraries and playlists. Syncing may not take much time, but it's very inconvenient.
* **it is difficult to add music to library from playlist**
Somehow your Music Library becomes crucial for your iTunes experience. Unlike Spotify, you can choose to use playlist or library to shortlist your favourite musics right? That isn't the case on Apple Music. This is absolutely fine for me... but I only realised this after I've finished manually migrating all my songs into my Apple Music playlist. It was quite ironic that even though adding songs to Music Library was necessary, the process wasn't as straightforward as pressing the + beside song. Because the + icon will not be available if the song is already downloaded offline (which my entire playlist is). Without those songs in Music Library, there will be no sync on PC and I can't play songs on PC properly. It will also not be organised both on PC/phone. In order to add those songs (I had ticked downloaded for offline for the entire playlist) to Music Library, I've to visit my Apple Music profile on my phone and open my playlist from there. Alternatively, I need to open up my PC and open my playlist from there.
**Edit:** https://1drv.ms/v/s!At2d63nj8IeDlm5cZbM4UZXCpUGN
* **the exclusivity is just for a bragging right** (since it'll likely be temporary, for like 1 week only), and it's rare.
* **the podcasts/music-related videos is just a feature. Nothing much special, all of them are accessible from YouTube.** There are more exclusives tho (i.e. Carpool Karaoke), but I'm confident they'll be available on YouTube eventually
* **playlists? ALL of them are so outdated** (the human curated ones). The automated ones like popularity, has nothing unique except its weight is lighter than Spotify's majestic stats. And when I say ""outdated,"" I mean several years old.
* **no way I can listen to all songs from a specific artiste.** This is so essential. Unlike Spotify, I can visit artiste's profile and click ""Shuffle"" or try ""This Is: [Name]""
* **lyrics only available for famous songs**
* **social interactions? It's worse than Spotify's. I can't see what my friends is streaming right now.** I can only see the PLAYLIST my friend is listening to. If that friend uses Library and doesn't use playlist to categorise songs, I won't be able to see what they are doing at all. And the ""social interaction between fans and artiste"" is just a lie. It works just like normal Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr posts. <--- that's bad because artiste has one more platform to share his/her posts. ---> which leads to inactivity. Even if it isn't inactive, the unthreaded comments is a mess, and all I can do is to ""Like"" artistes' posts, that's all for ""social interaction.""
* **cannot start playlist as radio** Complaining Spotify Radio is repetitive and lousy? Apple Music doesn't even allow you to discover new music based on your songs shortlisted in a playlist.
* **the *For You* recommendations is obsolete.** **This is my personalised recommendations:**

> - Too Good at Goodbyes (by Alex Goot)
> - Galway Girl Mashup (by Michael Constantino)
> - Wolves (by Sofia Karlberg)
> - Call It What You Want (by Andie Case)
> - Malibu (by Fly by Midnight)
> - Friends (by Matt McAndrew)

Horrible right? **↑** If you aren't a POP listener and don't understand what happening, basically Apple Music recommendations are based on my most listened songs' REPLICA.

Let's say I like Galway Girl by Ed Sheeran. Apple Music (according to the above), it would recommend me Galway Girl Mashup by artistes from nowhere. It's the same song as the original Ed Sheeran's Galway Girl. Or Friends is just a replica of Friends POP by Justin Bieber.

**PS:** The cons is endless. They are mentioned because of their priority. I left out miscellaneous things like buggy welcome fav artiste selection, difficult to find friends, glitchy help find friends via xxx (e.g. Facebook/Instagram,etc., it doesn't seem to work properly), you cannot quickly toggle stream phone/PC. A workaround for this is Remote app, which allows you to play music on computer from phone remotely, but it isn't integrated into phone's Music all-in-one. And as such it increases complexity.

**Edit 2:** In response to those who are negative on the tone of this post, I've written one post clearing the misunderstanding of the purpose of this thread. The purpose of this thread *isn't rant,* but a *wake-up call* for the Apple Music community that AM isn't doing fine. It's underperforming as a decent music streaming service.

"Apple Music is unworkableIs anybody else struggling with this?

I want to do something simple: make an Apple Music playlist sync between all of my devices, just like Spotify.

But if I want to do that I have to enable iCloud Music. When I do that the album art gets destroyed, and I had to restore a backup of my iTunes library.

Also when iCloud Music is enabled I can't sync music to my phone, so I've no way of managing the 320Kbps AAC and lossless ALAC files that are already on it. 

So I decided to settle for just creating playlists on my phone, but I still need iCloud Music for that. Now the problem is I have a half-uploaded iCloud Music library that has synced to my phone with loads of broken album art and I can't figure out how to wipe the music from iCloud.

I don't want to be forced into iCloud Music. If all I can do with Apple Music is browse and listen to songs without being able to create playlists, then I won't be taking out a subscription.

Are there any ways around these problems without subscribing to iTunes Match?",0,5,1556.7529409707752
"Apple Music is so slow.. Any way to improveI have been using Spotify for years now, but I recently got plenty of Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, Mac and Airpods), and I use Siri a lot. But I was not able to play music with Siri, which really annoyed me.

That's why I got the free Apple Music trial. And I am pretty much very disapointed for now.

On the iPhone App, it's ok.. The songs loads fairly quick, and the app itself is good enough. But on iTunes, it is just painful, the songs just don't load or very slowly, it stops several times while playing, when Spotify just plays the songs right away without any sensible load time or break.

But, the difference in sound won't take into effect unless you move literally move any of the EQ bars. When a song finishes after moving an EQ bar, the song will go back to sounding flat, as if the EQ settings were shut off.

"Apple Music Student Discount UNFAIR!I'm rather perplexed and I apologize if this issue has been addressed.  Although I have been  researching for seven days and I cannot find a reasonable answer. 

Regarding Apple Music Student Discount, I understand the logic behind their qualifications and not permitting certain institutions. However, Apple Music decided only four-year institutions offering a bachelors degree, only those students qualify for the Apple Music Student discount.   
How did they come to that conclusion? 
If they say they're following the guidelines put out by UNiDAY. I have been corresponding with UNiDAY and have been informed the guidelines have been set by Apple Music 
In fact, I have been told by UNiDAY, the subject is no longer up for discussion, which brings me to writing this....
Apple has their hands in so many charities around the world and it's admirable they are willing to help students with an Apple Music discount membership.  

What I do not understand is why Apple Music opted to penalize students going to a community college? 
A community college that receives the same funding as the public four-year institutions. 

Any student attempting to obtain a higher education should qualify for the student discount. 

If Apple Music attempt was to follow any type of government guidelines for accredited higher education, I understand there are some on-going battles to determine what constitutes accreditation.    CHEA.org Council for Higher Education Accreditation for example is trying to eliminate technical schools et al.  

I found a comprehensive list put out by U.S. News & World Report: EDUCATION. Their list is only comprised of non-profit, with only federal, state and local funding. 
May I suggest this list as a guideline? 
The two-year community college students are borrowing money to pay for their Apple products to help with their education just as much as the students at the four-year schools.  

Apple make products to help students and for those students to become business owners, with all Apple offers, charitable and otherwise I cannot imagine Apple wanting to dismiss or penalize this small population of students

Background of the artwork- Let’s be real, when they had that cool little feature it was awesome! I feel like Apple Music now seems so plain without it and it really complemented the artwork.

Friends- The friends feature has really improved and there’s nothing to complain about there. A cool thing that can be added, make a playlist and give permission to one of/ to all of your friends to edit and add to a playlist!

Also, has anyone found a listing of what’s an Apple Digital Master on Apple Music? The only way I’ve found to see if something is ADM is to look at the release in the iTunes Store.",0,7,4.776252926179656
"Apple Curated Playlists - Is there a way to find out what Tracks are new?I've been trying to get more into what Apple Music has to offer, and I have been adding a few playlists (Not including songs in the library just adding playlists).  I know that these playlists are updated weekly or bi-weekly but I was wondering if there was a way to find out what songs were added and what songs left?  The more I use this service, the more I wish the management aspects of it were better and more customizable.  I mean I focus a lot of play count and last played in my itunes library because I really do like tracking that kind of thing.  In terms of playlists, it would be nice to know what songs were added in what week.",0,3,25.14996820889965
"Apple Automatically Replacing Songs with Different Versions Without User ConsentSo this previously happened to me with a jazz piece by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. The song ""Maria"" was replaced with a slightly different version. When I say replaced, I mean totally without my knowledge and I only discovered it when the song came on and I thought it sounded rather odd. I'm very particular with my music and I can tell when there's a slight difference. This affects which version of a song I choose to put in my library when there are multiple sources to pick from. Needless to say, I was very upset for two reasons. First, the song I added to my library and got used to hearing for months is gone. This is still at least somewhat understandable on Apple's part because, after all, Apple Music is a streaming service which is dependent on record label contracts and you should expect this sort of thing every once in a while. However, I was not only upset because of this but more so because, without my consent or knowledge, Apple Music replaced my previous selection with something different. Granted, they didn't replace the jazz song with something totally unrelated but just because it has the same name doesn't mean it's the same recording. Again, I'm particular with my music, I like certain recordings because they sound a particular way and Apple tried to hide the fact that my selection became unavailable by changing it and that's not okay with me. Imagine taking out your favorite blu ray and when you pop it in the player, you notice it's a slightly different version of the movie you own. No one told you they tampered with it and replaced it to hide the fact that the original is gone. Not good.

Just now, I realized that the song ""Shooting Stars"" by Bag Raiders was replaced with a remix. This is even worse and is just unacceptable.

If record label contracts/deals with Apple change and certain songs that were previously available are removed or re-uploaded into the database under a different album, while that's already annoying because of a lack of consistency, I would appreciate it if Apple wouldn't also go and replace my selection for me after the fact. They've gotten it wrong twice already and this is a paid service which I use to keep my devices full of music for periods of time in which I can't afford to hook up to the internet and search around to get back certain songs. At the very least, if the song is no longer available, Apple Music should just notify you that the version you previously added to your collection is gone rather than replace it with something else.

My music library is sacred. Apple used to be a company that understood this. Going in and tweaking my song selections is a big no-no for me as a customer.

Has anyone else experienced this?",0,5,1179.9765983761213

"App is frustratingly slow on start-up [Android]When I start up my Spotify app, it is almost impossible for me to immediately jump into a new playlist, search for music, or access options for songs/albums. I can press play whatever was playing when I closed the app previously, but I don't want to play Tupac when I was trying to play Ed Sheeran for my two-year-old nephew. Attempting to open a new playlist or go to my library results in a blank menu with the loading symbol, and once that finally goes away (sometimes waiting as long as ten minutes), if I try to add a song to a playlist or the queue, I get an error message: ""Go online to see song options.""

If I click on any song it plays either Dirty Laundry or Best Life. I tried force stopping the app removing the album from my playlist, restarting my phone and different combinations of these. Furthest I got was being able to stream the album online but couldn't download it. I'm also not using any VPN or something, so that thing could not be giving the error.

"Android user, my downloaded files wont stay downloadedAs the title says. I download an album or playlist come back a month later and its deleted the entire thing or sometimes it leaves a couple of the songs and deletes the rest. It's super frustrating, I've spent years and years curating my library and making personal playlists. But ever since I've switched to android a few months ago. This app has been a bane.

I work as an electrician traveling a lot and the places I go often have terrible cell service. There is nothing more disappointing than going to my downloaded music and seeing half of it gone.

"Android USB audio output NOT working in my carHi People!

Here's the story.

I have a Fiat 500 with a 2015 Fiat original USB radio. It does not support bluetooth audio streaming. Only AUX through 3.5mm jack or USB AUX. Or well, I should buy one of those bluetooth aux dongles.

If I plug an iPhone via USB, I can listen to Spotify though my car hifi with no hassle, using a normal micro USB (+thunderbolt adapter) to USB cable.

I have tried to do the same with 3 android phones:

\- Samsung Galaxy S6 NOUGAT stock 7.0 rooted

\- Samsung Galaxy S7 OREO stock 8.0 rooted

\-Samsung Galaxy S3 NEO Nougat AOSP 7.1.2 rooted

No chances to tell the phone to send the audio through the mini USB port. I am using the same cable that I used for the iPhone, without the thunderbolt adapter, obviously.

My phones are all rooted and I have tried to modify the usb functionality inside the Android developer options. I have also tried an app (Audio Router 2.2 updated on 2018-01-22) that sould force the usb audio routing, but with no luck.

Is there anything I am missing?

"Album greyed outHey folks,

Posted on the Apple music forums, but thought I'd also post here.  I had (until recently) the entire Motorhead discography in a playlist on my phone, I went to play through it today and a number of tracks were greyed out.

Checking in Apple Music most of them were still there, so I rebuilt the playlist again.  Unfortunately, one of the albums 'Bastards' is not in Apple music anymore, it IS in Spotify (not a subscriber there, but i checked for this album before posting here) though, I guess the rights for this album were lost by Apple?

So  my question is 2 fold, well, actually 4 fold.

1. Why is it that occasionally i find tracks wont play because they're greyed out, then I have to go and re add them to playlists?
2. Are the missing album rights no longer available to Apple (despite the rest of the discography being there)?
3. Can I copy the cd to iTunes and have that album mixed in with downloaded albums (I think thats what I did originally), or will it simply grey out because Apple Music don't have the rights to it, despite it being ripped in iTunes by me?
4. When adding albums to playlists, why do some albums appear within the playlist in reverse order despite the actual album track order being correct before I added it?

Thanks for any advice..

"Adding new songs from radio & playlists in iOS 13I really don’t like the way they got rid of the ‘+’ button to add a song from the radio or some random playlist or whatever. It used to be a single tap but now it’s multiple. I usually added songs quickly then sorted them into playlists later. 

Now I don’t exactly know how to do it. It’s annoying if I get to near the end of a song I like and fiddling about looking for the add to library button and missing it. I’m sure I will get used to it but I don’t know why they’ve added more steps.",0,1,5.396310796712836

"Adding individual songs from playlist to My MusicI have a question regarding playlists and adding it to My Music.  

I know you can add a playlist to My Music like this (http://i.imgur.com/6PmtnZj.png). This puts the playlist in the Playlists-tab in iTunes. However, the songs are not added individually to My Music.  

Say I want to shuffle all my songs in My Music (which I do a lot), the songs in that playlist will never be played because they aren’t in My Music, only in that specific playlist.  

Is there any way to do this without adding each song individually to My Music like this (http://i.imgur.com/sd7ie3i.png)? Please tell me I’m overlooking something.

"Adding Entire Playlist's Contents to ""Songs"" in Library? (plus ranting about Apple Music's design)Let me begin by saying I am completely confused as to why the Apple Music library is formatted the way it is. It is very confusing to have the ""Songs"" and ""Playlists"" tabs both be considered in my ""Library"". Clicking ""Add to Library"" on a playlist just adds a playlist to my ""Playlists"" tab, not my ""Songs"" tab. This functionality, although confusing, is fine, but my problem arises when trying to add the entire playlist's contents to ""Songs"" (This is all on my iPhone 6, by the way, currently updated to iOS 12). 
I can ""Download"" a playlist, but this doesn't add the songs to my ""Songs"" library, just makes the music playable offline. Also, when a playlist is downloaded, songs within no longer show the + next to them to add them to my ""Songs"" library, making it even less convenient to save from playlists (although I can still long-press on a song and click ""Add to Library""). So, I have a few questions:

* Am I missing some way to add every song in a playlist to my ""Songs"" library? Do I have to manually add EVERY song to my ""Songs"" library? (I tried enabling ""Add Playlist Songs"" in settings and adding a playlist to a new dummy playlist -- no luck, didn't work)
* Is there a way to automatically save every song placed within a certain playlist to my ""Songs"" library? (becomes frustrating when adding new songs to an old playlist, but I don't want to enable it across all playlists -- some playlists are meant to be kept separate from my ""Songs"" list, so I don't want to enable the global ""Add Playlist Songs"" setting)
* If these functionalities (because of some very flawed designing) do not exist, is there a way to use a Shortcut to add every song in a playlist to ""Songs""?

I'm just disappointed with the lack of separation between ""Playlists"" and ""Songs"" in my library and lack of functionality within Apple Music. Sometimes I want the two categories to be separate, while other times I want a playlist to add its contents to ""Songs"" automatically (or at the very least be able to easily add all songs within a playlist to ""Songs""). The ""Songs"" tab should be renamed ""My Library"", and saved playlists should just be in their own separate place entirely. I love Apple's products, but man do they make using Apple Music hard, not to mention that Spotify (in my opinion) has a much wider catalog of playlists and superior capabilities to aid users in discovering new music. All these issues are honestly making me reconsider my switch to Apple Music, and I've been using it for a few months now.",0,5,391.2297928198371

I’m using AM since it’s started. It’s not the first time when I notice this problem. I add music to a playlist, and then I discover that it is not there. After the second attempt, it appears. So I assume iCloud library is enabled.",0,2,377.8849664341658

"A Very Negative Experience With Apple MusicHi all. I wanted to share an incredibly negative experience I am having with Apple and possibly entertain some advice on any avenues of action I might be able to take. 

Story goes:

I had to get a new debit card, and I was trying to update my billing info in my Apple Music app. The app asked for 2 Factor authentication using a phone number ending in 03. I've never had a phone number ending in 03 in my life, so it seemed as though my account may have been compromised. 

I called customer service to try to get access to my account back. Apparently, there is literally no way for me to get access to my account without access to this phone number. I explained that this phone number was clearly either non-existent or in somebody else's possession, but they said there was no other way to verify my identity. I didn't believe them, so I spent nearly an hour on the phone with managers, technical support, etc. It just seemed so archaic and non-sensical that a phone number would be the only possible way to verify an account.

Well, it turns out that it is exactly that non-sensical over at Apple. There's literally nothing they are either able or willing to do. 

So, once I had accepted that the account was gone forever, I asked for my purchased music as a download, and I would just make a new account. They said without access to the account that I could not access that music. 

This was where I became very upset. It seems as though Apple is holding my property against my will. I told them there were 2 outcomes that would be acceptable to me:  
1) Provide me with downloadable links to all my purchased music.  
2) Issue me a full refund for all my purchased music.   
They said neither was possible. I pleaded, I chastised them, I tried everything, but they wouldn't budge.   
Now I feel as though I shouldn't roll over and let them keep my property against my will. I sent their legal department an email requesting either my property or a refund within 72 hours time. If I don't receive either, I currently plan to file a small claims suit against them. I have plenty of PTO left this year, and its a matter of principle for me now.   


Is there anything else I can do?",0,14,18.299401077697123

Example: Play my liked songs on Spotify
Play my rap playlist on Spotify

Also, if someone else has made a playlist with the same as yours, and you want to play your playlist, make sure to say my **** playlist on Spotify

"99% of my music is goneI’ll start with the TL;DR,  I’ve just noticed that nearly all my music is gone from iTunes/Apple Music, tracks that I imported from my own personal CD collection and I’d like to know how to access it again. 

This might be a long post but I’ll hope it makes sense. 

I have used iTunes forever but never subscribed to Apple Music, using Spotify instead. I had a few playlists that I made on iTunes, with songs that I had imported from CDs over the last 15 years or so. I had also imported these playlists to Spotify. 

A little while ago tried to play one of these playlists on Spotify and noticed that all the tracks were gone and I said something along the lines of “let’s find some songs for your playlist”. Frustrated and curious, I opened up Apple Music and noticed that the original playlist was all gone except for 2 or 3 songs which I had downloaded (paid for) through iTunes. 

Also, my library has almost been completely obliterated of all my old music (including all the other playlists) and only the downloads remain. 

My question is, where the fuck is my music?? 

I paid good money and spent hours importing these CDs over the years. Do I need to pay for the subscription to Apple Music in order to have access to my own music again? 

Cheers.",0,1,15.330651076598851

The frequency of music and broadcasting was changed to 440 Hz for the malevolent purpose of creating disharmony in the world. The change took place in 1939. Look what happened after that.

You know that feeling you get after listening to music for a while and just being burnt out? Not wanting to listen to music anymore, but also struggling to really enjoy things with the same appreciation after that?

"10.000 songs limitHey. I've been using Tidal for quite a long time, but then decided to change it to Spotify like year and a half ago because i find some of Tidal features annoying.

What happened to me today is just ridiculous. 10.000 songs limit? Seriously Spotify? I hadn't had idea about this bullshit, and now I'm really mad as fk. 

I've read some threads concerning this, and I realise that I can do for example playlists of some albums, or just leave 1 song of each album, but this is just fkin madness. I've been paying for this shit for months and never expected something as stupid to come up.

I understand, that 10.000 songs is really a lot and most people probably don't even come close to this limit, however I'm a complete musical freak, listening to probably like 3 or 4 new albums each day and love tons of music from most of music genres. I also frequently add albums to my library that i don't find so great, but one day I'll probably want to come back to them. 

So is there any way (like seriously any way) i can get rid of this stupid limit? 

I'm really, really mad Spotify, this is complete absurd. ",1,5,515.6895449134017

"""unable to start station"" is a thing of the past?Something I noticed recently and might be related to iOS 13.

Instead it just continues playing your regular queue . At the same time I also noticed it can base stations on more tracks now, even if they're uploaded and not in the catalogue. It still has problems with really obscure artists though.  Overall a nice improvement in user experience.

"""You do not have permission to access this resource"" And other weirdnessHello all, I never knew there was a subreddit all about AM until this morning, cool! (although it seems obvious there should be). 

Anyways, I got into apple music on my iphone 6 when Dre's Compton came out, because I was dying to hear it and figured what the hell, free 3 months, cool! I went through the setup and all was well. I played Compton to death (and loved it), and then went on checking out other artists at will through AM. 

Anyways, it wasn't long before I ran into issues. I would go to play something and after a couple seconds of silence receive a pop-up message saying ""You do not have the permission required to access this resource."" Then AM would continue trying different songs on whichever album it was from until one worked. Strangely enough, 1 - 3 songs on any given album would usually be able to play reliably, while the rest would give me this message. This would happen on new albums as well as ones I had played without issue before, seemingly at random. 

Another weird quirk was that it would seem to have some kind of 'muscle memory' for songs I had listened to several times. Like, if I threw on an album, listened all the way through, then replayed tracks 3,4 and 7 a whole bunch because I really liked them, the next day I might open up the same album on AM and find that I can now ONLY listen to 3,4,7, and the rest present this message. I just don't understand.

As I'm typing this I have found that if I turn off my wifi connection I can get around *some* songs that have this problem. While others still have no issue, wifi or not. And some always display the message no matter what and seem totally out of reach.

One other small but annoying hangup I have experienced is that AM will just seem to pause itself out of nowhere. I will realize music has stopped and think that my headphones pulled out, or that it had a laggy moment and was buffering or something, but nope, I just have to press play again and we're good...not that big of an issue when I'm just walking around or something, but when I'm in the shower with music on, or otherwise have the phone out of arms reach playing off of some speakers, this can be quite frustrating.

Wtf, Apple Music? I had only intended to play out the free trial of this service originally, but after a couple weeks of pleasant streaming and exploring artists that piqued my curiosity, I was seriously considering continuing my subscription and paying for it. But not anymore...unless there is something I'm doing wrong, this is pretty much unusable in my eyes.",0,0,1454.3069571750939

"""I'm With the Banned""-Music Streaming and Identity PoliticsNotorious BIG, Flatbush Zombies, Antix, B.O.B, the Flobots, all have/had messages considered politically incorrect at some point in their careers, and their overall musical personas were often overshadowed by their more commercial hits. My point is, the thoughts and values behind lyrics are as important as the fresh beats they're lain upon. That said, what place is it for streaming services to promote some perspectives over others?

I'm not here to debate politics, in fact, I'm here to argue that music streaming services (not musicians) shouldn't involve themselves in identity politics, and I'm happy to unsubscribe. How does this have to do with music? Like Google, Spotify now filters music with politically incorrect messages and titles, and music is about free expression and dialogue, something lost by race-baiting rappers into cashing in on a trend rather than genuinely discussing political philosophy. In all of Spotify, there is only one artist with a secular humanist, anti-liberal message, and he's the only reason I bought premium to begin with.
