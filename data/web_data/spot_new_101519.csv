Went from Premium to Family Premium - lost all of my music,"Hi everyone. I've been Premium for a year and just found out about Family Premium so I added my boyfriend last night.

Since then, I have been unable to access my music. I've been on support chat for about two hours now with no success either. I am a subway commuter, so I download albums or playlists on spotify so that I can still listen on my commute. This morning, I couldn't play any of my downloaded music because it showed me no downloaded music! Anything I had listed as music was just ""regular"", no green downloaded icon beside it like usual. I wondered if it was maybe an error so I clicked on it, but it just said Spotify was offline and couldn't play that song at the time.

On my way home, I tried it again. It did the same thing. All of my music I had downloaded was un-downloaded. I couldn't play it. Still got the Spotify offline message. I don't understand. I know spotify is offline - that's why I downloaded the music!

Once I got above ground I tried, and when I opened it just said that something had gone wrong. Again on my computer as well. No music will play. Everything is there, I just can't actually access it.

I've been online with a Spotify support person for two hours now. I've tried multiple test accounts and it's still not working for me. I'm so annoyed and frustrated. She told me that basically my options are now to just individually create playlists of my own by individual song and download them, but I can't even search a song! She said that's basically it, that it doesn't look like I'm getting my music back. I can see my albums I have downloaded, but if I click on it, I get a black screen.

Is there anything I can do? Has this happened to anyone? I'm so rattled. Why did this happen as soon as I switched to Family? Could it really be that? Does anyone know...anything? Lol? At this point if I can't get my music back I'm going to cancel my subscription all together because I'm so annoyed, I can't believe this happened AND that after two hours of troubleshooting it still can't be fixed. Thank you to any help!!","['Hey, sorry to hear about this and hope they fix this asap. I have never paid for family premium and not sure what the costs are.

Local files as albums?,"So I'm potentially swapping to Spotify or Apple Music from Google Play Music since it'll be closing down at some point in favor of Youtube Music (+ Spotify & AM have bigger libraries). 

I'm trying to add in a few albums that aren't on Spotify through the Local Files section. From what I'm seeing online and experience, it doesn't look like you can integrate the Local Files with my actual Library. Whereas with GPM & AM, you can freely upload the files and have be apart of the Library. 

Is there any way around this? I really like the UI of Spotify (mobile & desktop), podcasts in the same mobile, discovery, etc., but not being able to have albums being integrated is a bit a let down. The only thing I think of doing is just create a playlist for each album.

Example: I have Frank Ocean's Endless album, but that's not on Spotify. Is the best bet to create a playlist for that album?

I also do like be able to the shuffle my entire Library, and it doesn't seem like you can do that without adding all my music into a playlist (if so, I'm cool with that).

Sorry for the dumb questions. Tried looking around a bit, but just making sure I'm not missing anything. Any help would be *greatly* appreciated!",[],1,2.1251078563211143,spotify

YouTube recommending me videos based of my Spotify search?,"Okay this probably sounds stupid but I rarely listen to any music on YouTube, only my Spotify app. And I watch tons of videos a day not related to music in anyway therefore my recommended section never shows anything to do with music.

Something very very strange is going on with Spotify on Bluetooth in my car,"I noticed that when driving listening to music that my music always pauses randomly for a few seconds but on the car display it say it is still playing.

It is very infuriating so I did some messing around on Spotify and looking at the car manual for Bluetooth audio playback and nothing.

But then noticed when I play some certain songs, it would ALWAYS pause at the same place for a bit and then join again at the same time. I noticed it because I played that song on repeat so many times for the past month and it was always that song that would pause so I did some testing. 

I played a random song i don‚Äôt listen to much on my long list of liked songs and there was no random pausing for these songs. Weird. I then searched up the song I played on repeat on YouTube and then the song‚Äôs audio pause at the EXACT place it usually pauses on Spotify wtffff

Does someone have any explanation for this? It literally makes no sense I‚Äôm going crazy at the moment on how strange this is even possible. I swear I‚Äôm not on any drugs but the audio would cut off in one particular song no matter what platform.

And it happened at 5am - a time where the only 3 devices I use were all in my house while everyone in the house was asleep. There was absolutely no way anyone could use those devices or access them remotely, as none of them were even connected to 4G or Wifi.\n\nSpotify tried to blame it on Facebook somehow providing access to Spotify, even though there was no sign of my Facebook account being hacked. I asked for an investigation and just got a download, several weeks later, of my Spotify data, which didn't help at all. Of course, I changed all my passwords again, and revoked Facebook access to Spotify, but I seriously doubt this was the cause.\n\nI suspect it's a glitch in Spotify that allows people to access someone else's account, perhaps unknowingly. Spotify's inept updates and constant re-arranging of the UI and other elements show that they have something seriously wrong with their programming management.

Strange Happenings. My Top Songs of 2018 is songs I've never listened to.,"Apart from one or two tracks I've never listened to any of them. Some bands/artists I've never even heard of. To be fair it's a really good playlist and I've ended up saving loads of tracks from it to my liked songs playlist. 


It's got a definitely feel of it being made by one single person, it has a certain style to it (I don't know why but I've decided it is female).



Also odd was that when I realised that it had one follower, but that follower wasn't me. So I followed it and now it has two followers.



Nobody else has my spotify login details and I listen to spotify every day, on the way to work, if I run out to get stuff whilst at work, on the way home for work, at the gym and lots more in the evening. Spend a huge amount of time on the weekend playing it. If somebody else was playing using my account then I would have seen by now. None of this stuff has ever been in my 'recently played' section and my Top Songs of 2017 were all songs that I had played on repeat a lot.



I noticed all this last night and then searched this morning in the actual search bar for 'Top Songs 2018' and two playlists came up. my actual one (that seems to be a fairly accurate representation of my listening habits of 2018, I say fairly as there is still some tracks that I don't really rate in there) and this other one that clearly isn't mine.




Partly I'm utterly mystified and creeped out, partly I'd like to thank this person for introducing me to some cool new stuff.




Any ideas of what has happened here?

Spotify Eating Ridiculous Amounts of Mobile Data This Month (iOS),"It's only the 10th of October and I'm already 787 MB out of 1 GB into my Mobile Data plan for this month, which hasn't happened before. I usually have a ton of extra internet to use, and utilise this chance by playing music I haven't downloaded in Spotify until the month ends.

This month... something seems different. 584/787 MB comes from Spotify itself, which makes absolutely no sense. I make sure I NEVER listen to any songs I haven't downloaded or stored in my Likes (all of which have been downloaded previously), yet I've wasted colossal amounts of mobile data on just Spotify this month. 

In Settings -> Mobile Data, there's a green thingy you can move left and right; does this disable the app's access to the internet entirely? I just moved it left, hoping it will not use any data until the end of the month.

What could possibly be the reason for so much Mobile Data being used up in such a short period of time? Is there any way to check what it is?

Android USB audio output NOT working in my car,"Hi People!

Here's the story.

I have a Fiat 500 with a 2015 Fiat original USB radio. It does not support bluetooth audio streaming. Only AUX through 3.5mm jack or USB AUX. Or well, I should buy one of those bluetooth aux dongles.

If I plug an iPhone via USB, I can listen to Spotify though my car hifi with no hassle, using a normal micro USB (+thunderbolt adapter) to USB cable.

I have tried to do the same with 3 android phones:

\- Samsung Galaxy S6 NOUGAT stock 7.0 rooted

\- Samsung Galaxy S7 OREO stock 8.0 rooted

\-Samsung Galaxy S3 NEO Nougat AOSP 7.1.2 rooted

No chances to tell the phone to send the audio through the mini USB port. I am using the same cable that I used for the iPhone, without the thunderbolt adapter, obviously.

My phones are all rooted and I have tried to modify the usb functionality inside the Android developer options. I have also tried an app (Audio Router 2.2 updated on 2018-01-22) that sould force the usb audio routing, but with no luck.

Is there anything I am missing?

How to prevent Spotify downloading songs again after clearing the cache? (Macbook),"Everytime I open Spotify on my Macbook, it begins downloading 3,401 songs!

I un-checked ""available offline"" on all of my playlists, I've scrolled through my whole library without seeing any green downloaded icons.

I tried editing some kind of text file within the cache folder to cap the download limit, which changed nothing.

I've cleared the cache...every time I close Spotify.

When I open it again it starts over, saying ""Downloading 1 of 3,401 Songs"" in the right-hand corner.

Is there any way to prevent / reset Spotify from downloading anything whatsoever?

Let's talk about Spotify/Siri integration.,"I'm not seeing a consistent formula for getting stuff to play correctly.

So for instance, saying ""Play <artist> <album> on spotify"" won't work, but saying ""Play <artist> album <album> on spotify"" works. Then for another artist I'll say ""Play <artist> album <album> on spotify"" and it won't work, but ""Play <artist> <album> on spotify"" will work. 

Sometimes saying just ""Play <album> on spotify"" works, sometimes it doesn't depending on album. Saying ""Play <artist> on spotify"" doesn't work consistently either.

*I couldn't find 'Lou Reed' in your music* (...okay?)

**""Play Lou Reed transformer on Spotify""**  

*Here's 'Transformer' by Lou Reed on Spotify* (correct)

*Sorry, I couldn't find 'the boy with the Arab strap in your music*  

**""Play it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing It's Blitz! by yeah Yeah Yeahs on Spotify* (??????)

**""Play transformer on Spotify""**  

*Now playing 'Transformer (feat. Nicki Minaj) by Future from Spotify.* (this one really threw me because I couldn't figure out how to play individual songs, but there must be a way)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs on Spotify""**

Expected iOS 13 Siri support for Spotify,"With Spotify's [latest release](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/spotify-new-music-and-podcasts/id324684580) for iOS 13, you can finally ask Siri to play albums, songs, and playlists, confirming a rumor that the two companies were working together. To use it, you simply install the update and ask Siri to play a track ""with Spotify."" The new integration also works with CarPlay, giving you hands-free control over Spotify tunes while you drive.

Spotify was able to use Siri thanks to the third-party audio integration [now included](https://crazygadgetshere.com/expected-ios-13-siri-support-for-spotify) in SiriKit as part of iOS 13. That allows you to say things like ""Play (album, track or playlist) on Spotify,"" ""Play the latest song from (artist) on Spotify,"" or ""Spotify (insert name) playlist.""

Playlist for everyone to get into German Rap,"Hi Reddit Community,

I have created a Spotify playlist for everyone who is interested in German Rap and its growing popularity.

For 2 years now, German Hip Hop has become the most popular and most successful music form in Germany. The variety of artists and Hip Hop genres represented has never been bigger. I myself have listened to German rap for over 15 years now and am totally passionate about this type of music.

For those of you who are interested in listening to Hip Hop outside the US (Germany is now the 2nd biggest market for HipHop worldwide), I have created this playlist with my personal favorite songs of the last two years. Give it a try, be open and you might find some new Hip Hop you like to listen to. German Hip Hop has really matured in the last years and the quality of music is better than ever.

Feel free to share this playlist with your friends and enjoy!

[Here is the playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4iaaVf1wOKDh75u00Hf1Tb?si=vuaP9F03Q7SZ1gB7h84nVg)

Spotify update this morning ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt fix the sharing to Instagram bug,"Yep I‚Äôm having that annoying ‚ÄúOops!‚Äù error when trying to share songs to my IG story.

Honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time an app developer went so long without fixing a problem like this and done nothing to keep their users informed of the issue. Considering canceling until they fix it because I‚Äôm not sure why I should continue paying them for a broken app. So frustrating. Has anyone heard anything from Spotify about this bug or when it will be fixed? This is at the point of unacceptability for me.

Does following an artist have any function?,"I follow a couple of artists, but I actually forgot it's even a feature, because it seems like it doesn't make a difference.

I thought if I follow someone it'll at least notify me if they have a new single or a new album, but no.

I almost exclusively listen to hiphop and then I get a popup that Pitbull or Lukas Graham has a new album/single.

But I follow artists like Danny Brown or Travis Scott just to name a couple artists who had a single or album released this week, and I got zero notifications from Spotify.

Suggesting a modified shuffle algorithm for Spotify.,"Considering that I have playlists that have songs from different artists and alot of songs from the same artist. I want Spotify to balance between playing songs from different artists and same artist. 
Example:
I have a rock playlist that consist of 100 song.
70 from the same artist (since I like this artist in particular)
30 from different artists. (I like the songs but not the discography of those artist)
Now; you might suggest separating the playlist same and different artist playlist.
I tried that and I didn't like it. When I am in mood to listen for rock. I don't want to keep switching between playlists. I just want to hit shuffel and have a balanced experience listening to same and different artist.
Here comes my suggestion:
If I use true shuffel I will just listen to more songs from the same artist.
So why not add the following features to the shuffel algorithm:
1- Don't play a song from the same artist twice in a row.
2-Don't play back the same song in the playlist till you play all other songs in the playlist even if I went to other playlists or turned off Spotify. (let's call it memory shuffle or queue). This way even when you come back to the playlist and hit shuffle you will resume your last que.
If we applied the past mentioned features. You will enjoy a smooth playlist with no recurrent songs playing again and again.
Tell me what do you think.
Can someone do this using Spotify api?","['If there‚Äôs 100 songs and 70 percent of them are from one artist there‚Äôs not a balanced chance you‚Äôll hear both equally, you‚Äôll hear the one artist 70% of the time, and everything else 30% of the time.

What is going on?,"I just got Spotify (and Spotify family premium) a month/two ago, made a playlist, downloaded it, and then made a separate playlist for a certain artist I liked. That‚Äôs it, occasionally adding new songs to my main playlist. 

One day, a bunch of edm playlists from this random edm label (I‚Äôm guessing) popped up in my recently played. Weird, but I‚Äôm not gonna go too crazy, those are probably a family members liked playlists (didn‚Äôt know how family premium worked yet). 

After that, those same playlists appeared in my liked playlists. I removed those. After, two artists started popping up in my liked and recently played. Removed all that, and this sorta keeps continuing for different small artists/label-made playlists.

But shit started getting odd when I was listening to my main playlist during class, and my songs literally stopped and started playing music from a rap label-made playlist (I think it was a label, the name of the playlist was EMG‚Äôs Favorite Hits or something close to that). I thought I was tripping, so I went to go shuffle my main playlist again. It worked for 50 seconds, and then another song from the same playlist paused my song to start playing. This happened again and again until I gave up on Spotify (during that class).

But what really set me off was when Spotify auto-generated a playlist called ‚ÄúMy favs‚Äù (never had a playlist in my life that I named ‚ÄúMy favs‚Äù) and it said that I created the playlist. It had two songs, one song from someone I don‚Äôt listen to, and one song from someone I don‚Äôt listen to or even know. I was creeped out by this, causing me to post here.

Does anyone know what the hell is going on with my account?","['Sounds like someone else has access to it.

My Spotify account was hacked and I recently got it back,"Like the title says, someone in Brazil hacked my account, and I got it back. When I got it back, my discover weekly and daily was all in Portuguese, and I had to ""Dislike"" or ""do not play"" a lot of songs to correct the algorithm. I logged on some time last week and noticed the ""do not play"" is gone.  I can no longer block songs or artists I don't want to hear.  This affected me with the new ""Repeats"" and ""Repeat/Rewinds"" auto playlist, its all in Portuguese. 

So i googled the issue and found an idea submission that was immediately closed by Spotify.  They closed it because they said it was a duplicate post.  They posted a hyperlink to the post the ""answered"" the original posters question, but instead, it was a link to another closed post in 2017. So basically they blew him off. 

So im here hoping some of you are like me and do like to use this option.  So i submitted my own idea to Spotify that requires a few votes for them to look at it.   If you can vote my idea up, that would be awesome.  My last resort would be to delete my account and start over again or use a different service.   [here](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Idea-Submissions/All-Platforms-Bring-Back-the-quot-do-not-play-dislike-quot/idc-p/4836587#M102353) is the link to my idea i submitted.

Intrusive Popups on Mobile,"I just added the following ""Idea"" to the Spotify Community since I've been seeing more popups lately in the app. I know they're suggestions and not ads, but they still get in the way especially when you're driving and have limited attention. These get closed without votes so I'm posting here in hopes some of you agree. Here's the relevant text I posted, you only need to visit the link if you're going to add a vote of support so it gets seen by the Spotify team.

 \------

I have been noticing occasional popups lately in the Spotify Android  App. While I like that Spotify gives me recommendations, I don't want  them pushed in my face when I'm trying to do something else. Especially  if I'm driving and just trying to start my music without taking my  attention from the road.

I think the ""currently listening  from another device"" popup is an exception - it makes sense to have that  one. Music suggestions or new feature notice popups are not good.

I'd  be content with an option to turn this off, but please reconsider  anything that requires a link called ""dismiss."" I know it probably  drives user actions that you want or maybe just actions that happen to  be one of the metrics you measure, but it's unpleasant when you're in a  hurry and dangerous for drivers.

I've seen many complaints and questions regarding local files but haven't seen a solution to my problem.
I've a bunch of albums on my computer. I tried to have them on the spotify software and succeedeed but one album did not show up there.

Making collaborative playlists public on my profile?,"Hello 

I have been using my wife's Spotify for the past 6 years. I have about 50 playlists there. Recently I decided I needed to have my own Spotify account, since we were both needed to use Spotify for work at the same time of day. We made all of my playlists collaborative so that I can keep using them from my new account, but they are not showing up as ""public playlists"" on my own profile. Is there a way to make these playlists visible for people who visit my profile? 

Hope this is the place to ask. Thank you.","[""I've also noticed spotify can be a bit janky when it comes to showing playlists on your page (I.e secret playlists aren't always hidden), so you might be best off recreating them on your new profile if you want to show them off \n\nObviously this is a pain when you have so many, but you can ctrl+a on the desktop app and just copy and paste them to save time\n\nYou'll lose the dates of when the songs were added but if that doesn't bother you this is the only thing I can think of.

Changing my profile photo,"Hi 

So I've tried googling this so many times and I can never find an answer. I know that to change your profile photo you have to use the laptop app, click on your profile, hover over your profile, and there should be a 'change' option. 

HOWEVER

Last week I was trying a whole bunch of different photos just to see how it would look as my profile photo, I changed it maybe \~10 times. When I would change it, I would need to refresh the app or wait a few minutes for the new photo to be updated on my macbook and on my iphone app. At one point spotify started glitching a little and stopped updating when I changed the photo, and then started randomly going between the previous photos I had tried before. 

Now, it's stuck on this one photo that I don't want. There's no option for me to change the photo- there's no 'Change' when I hover over my profile. It's disappeared. The only button I see is the three dots on the right that allow you to 'share'. 

I've tried deleting the macbook app, redownloading, trying to find ways to change my profile on mobile, web, etc. 

Has anyone had the same problem before, or have I just reached a limit of being able to change my profile? If so how long do I have to wait before it lets me change it again... it would be really dumb if spotify stopped letting me change my profile forever. 

Thanks in advance!","['Same issue here, and a lot of people are experiencing it. Try searching this sub for the word ""Spotify"".\n\nI\'m shocked to learn Spotify has zero presence in this sub - 0 communication with their user base.']",1,10.954482861688291,spotify
