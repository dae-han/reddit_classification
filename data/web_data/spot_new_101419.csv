YouTube recommending me videos based of my Spotify search?,"Okay this probably sounds stupid but I rarely listen to any music on YouTube, only my Spotify app. And I watch tons of videos a day not related to music in anyway therefore my recommended section never shows anything to do with music. 

Anyway this thing has happened a few times recently where I’ll listen to a song that I’ve entered into the search engine for Spotify and the same song or something related to the song will show up in my recommendations. For an example I was listening to comfortably numb today on Spotify and one of the first recommendations that showed up a few hours later was an 8 year old video of Roger Waters talking about how he wrote that song.  There is a few more examples that I can’t remember but it’s always an out of place recommendation about that exact song.

It’s probably just a coincidence it’s just super weird how these things are showing up in my YouTube","[""It's definitely happened to me a couple of times too. It's fucking creepy man.  I don't know who's to blame for it, Spotify or Google, but it's a little too invasive for my tastes.""]",2,1.045638576064397,spotify
"Hiya Reddit, I live in Los Angeles and today is my favorite day of the week to be out driving/working in this city!

Again, it\'s a flow playlist, so I recommend hitting shuffle play until the pace/flow/feel of the first song hits right. From there just move with the music (especially if you\'re driving), it\'ll get you where you need to go.\n\nCurrently at 123 songs and just under 8 hours of total playtime That Sunday Swerve hits quite a few genres of music with artists/tracks that range from relatively unknown (<1000 plays) to some of the bigger names/songs I listen to (200,000,000+ plays). I\'ve never really been great with properly identifying genres due to how literal I take things, but I\'ll do my best lol... Let\'s see... Bass music, you\'ll find a lottle bass music in this playlist, this ranges from dubstep, to DnB, funky bands with great bass lines, electronic/hiphop fusions, pop sounding music that knows how to hit the bass right... I fucking love bass yo 😆\n\nA decent amount of indie/alternative types ended up on this playlist too.\n\nSome of my favorite artists and/or tracks on here are as follows:\n\nSaint Sinner and Tycho (at least 6 of their tracks are on here probably more ""Get to You"" and ""For How Long"" are my 2 faves currently)\n\nJust A Gent (something about this guy\'s bass and flow is just too good idk)\n\nChinese Man (one of my top 5 most played artists from 2018, dude\'s beats are despicably smooth and the MC\'s he works with are pure fire)\n\nFor the indie/alt/pop side some of my favorites on this playlist are Tora, Tash Sultana, Rex Orange County, WENS, Billie Eilish, Two Feet, Foals, and SG Lewis\n\nAnd to the strip club DJ that keeps posting, if you\'re reading this, I feel like you could probably use 80% of this playlist at work lol']",1,1.0637520019903226,spotify

Something very very strange is going on with Spotify on Bluetooth in my car,"I noticed that when driving listening to music that my music always pauses randomly for a few seconds but on the car display it say it is still playing.

It is very infuriating so I did some messing around on Spotify and looking at the car manual for Bluetooth audio playback and nothing.

But then noticed when I play some certain songs, it would ALWAYS pause at the same place for a bit and then join again at the same time. I noticed it because I played that song on repeat so many times for the past month and it was always that song that would pause so I did some testing. 

I played a random song i don’t listen to much on my long list of liked songs and there was no random pausing for these songs. Weird. I then searched up the song I played on repeat on YouTube and then the song’s audio pause at the EXACT place it usually pauses on Spotify wtffff

Does someone have any explanation for this? It literally makes no sense I’m going crazy at the moment on how strange this is even possible. I swear I’m not on any drugs but the audio would cut off in one particular song no matter what platform.

EDIT: this only happens in the car Bluetooth audio. Speakers and headphones are all good","[""It's Spotify.

Strange Happenings. My Top Songs of 2018 is songs I've never listened to.,"Apart from one or two tracks I've never listened to any of them. Some bands/artists I've never even heard of. To be fair it's a really good playlist and I've ended up saving loads of tracks from it to my liked songs playlist. 


It's got a definitely feel of it being made by one single person, it has a certain style to it (I don't know why but I've decided it is female).



Also odd was that when I realised that it had one follower, but that follower wasn't me. So I followed it and now it has two followers.



Nobody else has my spotify login details and I listen to spotify every day, on the way to work, if I run out to get stuff whilst at work, on the way home for work, at the gym and lots more in the evening. Spend a huge amount of time on the weekend playing it. If somebody else was playing using my account then I would have seen by now. None of this stuff has ever been in my 'recently played' section and my Top Songs of 2017 were all songs that I had played on repeat a lot.



I noticed all this last night and then searched this morning in the actual search bar for 'Top Songs 2018' and two playlists came up. my actual one (that seems to be a fairly accurate representation of my listening habits of 2018, I say fairly as there is still some tracks that I don't really rate in there) and this other one that clearly isn't mine.




Partly I'm utterly mystified and creeped out, partly I'd like to thank this person for introducing me to some cool new stuff.




Any ideas of what has happened here?

It still does not seem like this was added to the app but I wasn’t sure if it was just something I was missing as far as where to access the history. I’m specifically on an iPad and was wondering if anyone has a workaround using a browser and the desktop site version of Spotify.com, though I’m not sure if the browser player can provide song history either.

1. If I turn off both “Publish Activity” AND “Show my Recently Played Artists” AND I make all of my playlists secret, will they still be able to see anything on my profile? I just wanna be a name and nothing else.

2. If I opt out of the family mix ASAP, all of my contributed songs will vanish from the mix, right?

Thank you! :)","['Family Mix is the only family-specific feature, so other than that the privacy concerns are exactly the same as they are right now before you join the plan.']",3,3.7186825586689842,spotify

Any suggestions for a new Spotify listening device?,"So I am (as I'm sure much of you are) a avid user of Spotify and I love listening to music. I generally plug in my headphones when I leave my apartment and don't stop listening to music until I get home, sometimes some 10-12 hours after I left. 

Because of this however, my phone's battery dies at least once a day and I need a better solution. I would like buy a new device solely for listening to music, and then use my phone for only a phone use.

I have done some research online, and it seems like the mighty Spotify player is the only other device I could use that's not a smart watch or phone, however this seems to only have a battery life of around 5 hours which is too short. 

Do you guys have any advice? Thanks so much!","[""You could just buy a  cheap, used smart phone on ebay and just not pay for cell service on it.

But if you know Spotify (or this sub) well enough, you know that shuffle is (was?) frustratingly un-random. There have been conspiracy theories about prioritizing low royalty fee songs. Who knows what the reason really is.

Spotify Eating Ridiculous Amounts of Mobile Data This Month (iOS),"It's only the 10th of October and I'm already 787 MB out of 1 GB into my Mobile Data plan for this month, which hasn't happened before. I usually have a ton of extra internet to use, and utilise this chance by playing music I haven't downloaded in Spotify until the month ends.

This month... something seems different. 584/787 MB comes from Spotify itself, which makes absolutely no sense. I make sure I NEVER listen to any songs I haven't downloaded or stored in my Likes (all of which have been downloaded previously), yet I've wasted colossal amounts of mobile data on just Spotify this month. 

In Settings -> Mobile Data, there's a green thingy you can move left and right; does this disable the app's access to the internet entirely? I just moved it left, hoping it will not use any data until the end of the month.

What could possibly be the reason for so much Mobile Data being used up in such a short period of time? Is there any way to check what it is?

Many thanks.",['If you are on IPhone you can go to cellar data in settings and disable the apps ability to use your data.'],2,4.207073762557573,spotify

Android USB audio output NOT working in my car,"Hi People!

Here's the story.

I have a Fiat 500 with a 2015 Fiat original USB radio. It does not support bluetooth audio streaming. Only AUX through 3.5mm jack or USB AUX. Or well, I should buy one of those bluetooth aux dongles.

If I plug an iPhone via USB, I can listen to Spotify though my car hifi with no hassle, using a normal micro USB (+thunderbolt adapter) to USB cable.

I have tried to do the same with 3 android phones:

\- Samsung Galaxy S6 NOUGAT stock 7.0 rooted

\- Samsung Galaxy S7 OREO stock 8.0 rooted

\-Samsung Galaxy S3 NEO Nougat AOSP 7.1.2 rooted

No chances to tell the phone to send the audio through the mini USB port. I am using the same cable that I used for the iPhone, without the thunderbolt adapter, obviously.

My phones are all rooted and I have tried to modify the usb functionality inside the Android developer options. I have also tried an app (Audio Router 2.2 updated on 2018-01-22) that sould force the usb audio routing, but with no luck.

Is there anything I am missing?

Skipping Songs,"Hi Spotify,

Whenever I want to play a song it would skip on the 6th song then the song would play and **STOP** at 0:09 (this stops forever).

Discover Weekly vs Release Radar,"After using Spotify for a couple of years daily I've noticed a pretty big difference between release radar and discover weekly. First of all discover weekly almost always features shit songs in my case. It is mostly acoustic versions of songs I normally listen to, which I really hate (the acoustic version). I'm also too lazy to actively moderate my Discover Weekly. The Release Radar on the other hand seems to feature pretty good songs in my opinion although it very often does not feature new songs by artists i 'subscribed' to, which is kinda strange. Is this common? Or do people have different opinions?","['Both of them suck for me.

Let's talk about Spotify/Siri integration.,"I'm not seeing a consistent formula for getting stuff to play correctly.

So for instance, saying ""Play <artist> <album> on spotify"" won't work, but saying ""Play <artist> album <album> on spotify"" works. Then for another artist I'll say ""Play <artist> album <album> on spotify"" and it won't work, but ""Play <artist> <album> on spotify"" will work. 

Sometimes saying just ""Play <album> on spotify"" works, sometimes it doesn't depending on album. Saying ""Play <artist> on spotify"" doesn't work consistently either. 

I've been unsuccessful in getting specific songs to play. I was unable to get the album ""The Boy with the Arab Strap"" to play using any method. 

Below are some examples of inconsistencies. 

(I left in capitalization as transcribed by Siri)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing 'This is Yeah Yeah Yeahs' from Spotify* (Playlist, incorrect)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs album it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing It's Blitz! by Yeah Yeah Yeahs from Spotify* (Oh hey, that works)

**""Play Lou Reed album transformer on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'Lou Reed' in your music* (...okay?)

**""Play Lou Reed transformer on Spotify""**  

*Here's 'Transformer' by Lou Reed on Spotify* (correct)

**""Play Belle and Sebastian The Boy with the Arab strap on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'The Boy with the Arab strap' in your music*

**""Play belle and Sebastian album the boy with the Arab strap on Spotify""**  

*I couldn't find 'belle and Sebastian' in your music.*

**""Play the boy with the Arab strap on Spotify""**  

*Sorry, I couldn't find 'the boy with the Arab strap in your music*  

**""Play it's blitz on Spotify""**  

*Now playing It's Blitz! by yeah Yeah Yeahs on Spotify* (??????)

**""Play transformer on Spotify""**  

*Now playing 'Transformer (feat. Nicki Minaj) by Future from Spotify.* (this one really threw me because I couldn't figure out how to play individual songs, but there must be a way)

**""Play Yeah Yeah Yeahs on Spotify""**  

*Here's 'This is Yeah Yeah Yeahs' from Spotify*

**""Play Dinosaur Jr. on Spotify""**

Why does Spotify randomly decides to un-download 250 songs off my downloaded playlists?,"It has done it atleast 3-4 times, it's annoying as hell.

I have a Galaxy s7 been using Spotify Premium for about 5 years

So I add a new song to my playlist on my desktop, and today when I was going out for school I pulled my phone because I wanted to listen to that specific song, guess what, I can't: First I have to download around 250 songs that magically got unloaded from my library. Wtf?

So I can't play it because Spotify is too busy downloading, what's the fucking point?? Why can't I at least stop or pospone the download process? Why is it even re-downloading them in the first place?

Does this happen to anyone else? It's ridiculous.",0,0,7.187629319710864,spotify

Expected iOS 13 Siri support for Spotify,"With Spotify's [latest release](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/spotify-new-music-and-podcasts/id324684580) for iOS 13, you can finally ask Siri to play albums, songs, and playlists, confirming a rumor that the two companies were working together. To use it, you simply install the update and ask Siri to play a track ""with Spotify."" The new integration also works with CarPlay, giving you hands-free control over Spotify tunes while you drive.

Spotify was able to use Siri thanks to the third-party audio integration [now included](https://crazygadgetshere.com/expected-ios-13-siri-support-for-spotify) in SiriKit as part of iOS 13. That allows you to say things like ""Play (album, track or playlist) on Spotify,"" ""Play the latest song from (artist) on Spotify,"" or ""Spotify (insert name) playlist."" That puts Spotify on an equal footing with Apple Music, except that you need to add the ""with Spotify"" qualifier or Siri will default to Apple Music.","['i cant get this to work, ive used alot of the default commands like ""Play Taylor Swift using Spotify"" but it just says ""Spotify hasn\'t added support for that with Siri"".']",6,7.3985205236104905,spotify

Playlist for everyone to get into German Rap,"Hi Reddit Community,

I have created a Spotify playlist for everyone who is interested in German Rap and its growing popularity.

For 2 years now, German Hip Hop has become the most popular and most successful music form in Germany. The variety of artists and Hip Hop genres represented has never been bigger. I myself have listened to German rap for over 15 years now and am totally passionate about this type of music.

For those of you who are interested in listening to Hip Hop outside the US (Germany is now the 2nd biggest market for HipHop worldwide), I have created this playlist with my personal favorite songs of the last two years. Give it a try, be open and you might find some new Hip Hop you like to listen to. German Hip Hop has really matured in the last years and the quality of music is better than ever.

Feel free to share this playlist with your friends and enjoy!

Spotify update this morning — doesn’t fix the sharing to Instagram bug,"Yep I’m having that annoying “Oops!” error when trying to share songs to my IG story. Been happening for about three weeks at this point. Checked today and saw there was an app update and I was like oh cool they FINALLY fixed it. Ha ha NOPE, it didn’t fix anything. 

Honestly can’t remember the last time an app developer went so long without fixing a problem like this and done nothing to keep their users informed of the issue. Considering canceling until they fix it because I’m not sure why I should continue paying them for a broken app. So frustrating. Has anyone heard anything from Spotify about this bug or when it will be fixed? This is at the point of unacceptability for me.

UPDATE: Today was the day, I guess. Finally they fixed it and I can share to IG stories again.

Migrating Liked songs to another account/new playlist,"I've a previous Spotify account with over 3k+ liked songs. I wanted to transfer these to another account by creating a public playlist and then opening that playlist on my second account. Now the problem is that whenever I try to select all the songs in my ""Liked Songs"", many of the songs always get left out due to limitations in Spotify where it only lets you select upto 1k songs (?). Is there a way to move ALL the songs to a playlist? Maybe an online tool or something? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!!

Edit: [tunemymusic.com](https://tunemymusic.com) allows you to do it pretty seamlessly.

1. Logged in into previous acc.

4. imported from txt file.

Does following an artist have any function?,"I follow a couple of artists, but I actually forgot it's even a feature, because it seems like it doesn't make a difference.

I thought if I follow someone it'll at least notify me if they have a new single or a new album, but no. It never does that on PC, and sometimes I get a popup on my phone but ONLY for artists I don't follow and whom couldn't be further from my taste. I almost exclusively listen to hiphop and then I get a popup that Pitbull or Lukas Graham has a new album/single.

But I follow artists like Danny Brown or Travis Scott just to name a couple artists who had a single or album released this week, and I got zero notifications from Spotify.

Everything is enabled in the settings, so I'm confused, what is it supposed to do, or is it actually working for someone?","['I get emails letting me know about new music from artists that I follow.', 'I can quickly go down my list of followed artists and drill down to their albums.

Suggesting a modified shuffle algorithm for Spotify.,"Considering that I have playlists that have songs from different artists and alot of songs from the same artist. I want Spotify to balance between playing songs from different artists and same artist. 
Example:
I have a rock playlist that consist of 100 song.
70 from the same artist (since I like this artist in particular)
30 from different artists. (I like the songs but not the discography of those artist)
Now; you might suggest separating the playlist same and different artist playlist.
I tried that and I didn't like it. When I am in mood to listen for rock. I don't want to keep switching between playlists. I just want to hit shuffel and have a balanced experience listening to same and different artist.
Here comes my suggestion:
If I use true shuffel I will just listen to more songs from the same artist.
So why not add the following features to the shuffel algorithm:
1- Don't play a song from the same artist twice in a row.
2-Don't play back the same song in the playlist till you play all other songs in the playlist even if I went to other playlists or turned off Spotify. (let's call it memory shuffle or queue). This way even when you come back to the playlist and hit shuffle you will resume your last que.
If we applied the past mentioned features. You will enjoy a smooth playlist with no recurrent songs playing again and again.
Tell me what do you think.
Can someone do this using Spotify api?","['If there’s 100 songs and 70 percent of them are from one artist there’s not a balanced chance you’ll hear both equally, you’ll hear the one artist 70% of the time, and everything else 30% of the time.

What is going on?,"I just got Spotify (and Spotify family premium) a month/two ago, made a playlist, downloaded it, and then made a separate playlist for a certain artist I liked. That’s it, occasionally adding new songs to my main playlist. 

One day, a bunch of edm playlists from this random edm label (I’m guessing) popped up in my recently played. Weird, but I’m not gonna go too crazy, those are probably a family members liked playlists (didn’t know how family premium worked yet). 

After that, those same playlists appeared in my liked playlists. I removed those. After, two artists started popping up in my liked and recently played. Removed all that, and this sorta keeps continuing for different small artists/label-made playlists.

But shit started getting odd when I was listening to my main playlist during class, and my songs literally stopped and started playing music from a rap label-made playlist (I think it was a label, the name of the playlist was EMG’s Favorite Hits or something close to that). I thought I was tripping, so I went to go shuffle my main playlist again. It worked for 50 seconds, and then another song from the same playlist paused my song to start playing. This happened again and again until I gave up on Spotify (during that class).

But what really set me off was when Spotify auto-generated a playlist called “My favs” (never had a playlist in my life that I named “My favs”) and it said that I created the playlist. It had two songs, one song from someone I don’t listen to, and one song from someone I don’t listen to or even know. I was creeped out by this, causing me to post here.

Does anyone know what the hell is going on with my account?","['Sounds like someone else has access to it.

My Spotify account was hacked and I recently got it back,"Like the title says, someone in Brazil hacked my account, and I got it back. When I got it back, my discover weekly and daily was all in Portuguese, and I had to ""Dislike"" or ""do not play"" a lot of songs to correct the algorithm. I logged on some time last week and noticed the ""do not play"" is gone.  I can no longer block songs or artists I don't want to hear.  This affected me with the new ""Repeats"" and ""Repeat/Rewinds"" auto playlist, its all in Portuguese. 

So i googled the issue and found an idea submission that was immediately closed by Spotify.  They closed it because they said it was a duplicate post.  They posted a hyperlink to the post the ""answered"" the original posters question, but instead, it was a link to another closed post in 2017. So basically they blew him off. 

So im here hoping some of you are like me and do like to use this option.  So i submitted my own idea to Spotify that requires a few votes for them to look at it.   If you can vote my idea up, that would be awesome.  My last resort would be to delete my account and start over again or use a different service.

Intrusive Popups on Mobile,"I just added the following ""Idea"" to the Spotify Community since I've been seeing more popups lately in the app. I know they're suggestions and not ads, but they still get in the way especially when you're driving and have limited attention. These get closed without votes so I'm posting here in hopes some of you agree. Here's the relevant text I posted, you only need to visit the link if you're going to add a vote of support so it gets seen by the Spotify team.

 \------

I have been noticing occasional popups lately in the Spotify Android  App. While I like that Spotify gives me recommendations, I don't want  them pushed in my face when I'm trying to do something else. Especially  if I'm driving and just trying to start my music without taking my  attention from the road.

I think the ""currently listening  from another device"" popup is an exception - it makes sense to have that  one. Music suggestions or new feature notice popups are not good.

I'd  be content with an option to turn this off, but please reconsider  anything that requires a link called ""dismiss."" I know it probably  drives user actions that you want or maybe just actions that happen to  be one of the metrics you measure, but it's unpleasant when you're in a  hurry and dangerous for drivers.

They are MP3 files and are read easily on other media softwares like VLC.

Thanks :)",0,0,9.469596914201976,spotify

Making collaborative playlists public on my profile?,"Hello 

I have been using my wife's Spotify for the past 6 years. I have about 50 playlists there. Recently I decided I needed to have my own Spotify account, since we were both needed to use Spotify for work at the same time of day. We made all of my playlists collaborative so that I can keep using them from my new account, but they are not showing up as ""public playlists"" on my own profile. Is there a way to make these playlists visible for people who visit my profile? 

Hope this is the place to ask. Thank you.","[""I've also noticed spotify can be a bit janky when it comes to showing playlists on your page (I.e secret playlists aren't always hidden), so you might be best off recreating them on your new profile if you want to show them off \n\nObviously this is a pain when you have so many, but you can ctrl+a on the desktop app and just copy and paste them to save time\n\nYou'll lose the dates of when the songs were added but if that doesn't bother you this is the only thing I can think of. Of course it'll serve as a back-up too in case anything happens, I know I wouldn't wanna lose all that work\n\nHope this helps :))""]",3,9.556252006841477,spotify

Just had the same issue. My echo has been pissing me off. It will frequently disconnect or just stop playing.

Changing my profile photo,"Hi 

So I've tried googling this so many times and I can never find an answer. I know that to change your profile photo you have to use the laptop app, click on your profile, hover over your profile, and there should be a 'change' option. 

HOWEVER

Last week I was trying a whole bunch of different photos just to see how it would look as my profile photo, I changed it maybe \~10 times. When I would change it, I would need to refresh the app or wait a few minutes for the new photo to be updated on my macbook and on my iphone app. At one point spotify started glitching a little and stopped updating when I changed the photo, and then started randomly going between the previous photos I had tried before. 

Now, it's stuck on this one photo that I don't want. There's no option for me to change the photo- there's no 'Change' when I hover over my profile. It's disappeared. The only button I see is the three dots on the right that allow you to 'share'. 

I've tried deleting the macbook app, redownloading, trying to find ways to change my profile on mobile, web, etc. 

Has anyone had the same problem before, or have I just reached a limit of being able to change my profile? If so how long do I have to wait before it lets me change it again... it would be really dumb if spotify stopped letting me change my profile forever. 

Thanks in advance!","['Same issue here, and a lot of people are experiencing it. Try searching this sub for the word ""Spotify"".\n\nI\'m shocked to learn Spotify has zero presence in this sub - 0 communication with their user base.']",1,9.837282099594121,spotify

Downloading Playlists to MP3?,"Been using Spotify loyally as a 7 year premium member.  
I spend a lot of time scavenging playlists for songs to DJ to add to my playlists and I've accrued hundreds of songs on my playlists.  
Been looking all over the internet for a converter that let's me convert my playlists to MP3, and so far, I've had no luck.  
I don't mind paying for software (free would be ideal too), and I tried Spotdl.com and it didn't seem to work for me, I left it converting overnight and it never downloaded anything (mind you, I have fast internet and my computer has high specs).

Anyone had any luck with any other software or websites? I have way too many songs on my playlists to download individually.

What's your workflow for adding albums to listen to offline?,"Hello everyone,

This new update is making me feel a bit technology illiterate, so I wanted to see how other people are using the app now. Before the big change to how libraries work, if I wanted to listen to an album, I would just 'Save' it. This would put all of the songs into my saved songs list, which I would download for offline listening. Very simple, straightforward.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what to do, so I wanted to ask you all about your new workflow for saving albums to listen to offline. When I click 'save' on an album now, it shows up in my 'albums' list, but there doesn't seem to be a way to save it offline without manually going to every album and saving it offline (which is annoying, because as of recently the app has been *painfully* unresponsive for me). 

Is this just the reality now? Or are there other ways of doing it?","[""Let me tell you, fellow album listener. The fact that you can no longer save an entire album to a playlist is making me reconsider switching from Spotify.\n\nI normally use an almanac list to save all the albums (and ultimately songs) I want to listen to for the year. This is now a very painful process.\n\nAll I have at the moment is to save the album then download it from the album screen. For the life of me, I do not understand what was gained by removing the option to add an entire album to a playlist from that screen. If anyone knows the answer, please let me know!\n\nThe album should still be available under the Library > Artist, where you can download it. Interesting enough, you can also save the entire album to a specific playlist, if that's how you normally make sure your music is downloaded.\n\nHope this helps!""]",1,10.36883302607746,spotify
