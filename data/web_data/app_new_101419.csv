"iCloud didn‚Äôt delete all my music, I did by accident/purpose","My dad created his Apple ID account when we got our first MacBook(2012).  After years and turning into an adult of my own, I created my own Apple ID for the separate messages and photo sharing options but continued to use his for everything else. I even pay for the Apple Music family plan on his Apple ID. Using two Apple Ids had some bumps as expected but nothing that made me regret it so far.

What stops me from using ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù and how I got iTunes back on Catalina,"So, originally I was pretty hyped for the new Music application, hoping stuff like ‚Äúfor you‚Äù and ‚Äúbrowse‚Äù would finally be more responsive.     But, since it‚Äôs a web based interface, they weren‚Äôt....       Also the Album-View just sucks. I don‚Äôt want a whole new window to open when I click on an album.   They way it folded down in iTunes was perfect. I could open and album and browse for other albums on the same page. The new interface just seems clumsy to me.
But the biggest drawback for me certainly is the lack of any remote control function.   The classic iTunes remote app doesn‚Äôt work with ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù.     So I tried to get my old iTunes back.     I still hat the app laying around in my TimeMachine.  But just copying the app gives you an error.    So I found I script online which allows me to ‚Äúreinstall‚Äù the iTunes i had already copied.   iTunes works like a charm (syncing, library, remote) the only buggy thing is that it prevents finder from accessing your iDevices (so you have to sync via iTunes) and when opening the app it always asks for permission for inbound network activity (guess it‚Äôs for the remote)

iTunes gone?,"Hey guys. I am, and always have been, an avid iTunes user. I have Apple Music as well, but I barely use it. WHY? Because a lot of the music I listen to is not offered. I‚Äôm very compulsive with my music. I have a system. I listen to a lot of artists and I like to go through their discographies chronologically. I like to listen to everything an artist has released.

I‚Äôll use The Felice Brothers as an example. The Felice Brothers are a folk band from New York. They have a pretty extensive discography. I have bought, file shared, or torrented all their music. In my iTunes, I have all their albums organized by album and year. For bonus tracks and singles, I download the audio file off of YouTube and organize them into my iTunes in respect to the album they belong to or year of release. Apple Music has maybe five or six Felice Brothers albums and maybe one or two EPs. They‚Äôre lacking a lot of material. I understand that I will still be able to import my files into Apple Music, but will they be arranged the way I arrange them in my iTunes? This is one example of many artists whose music is scarce on Apple Music.

Now the syncing issue. When I listen to music, I like to keep track of my play count. Once I listen to an album five times, I‚Äôll give it a rating. When my music is listened to on my iPod and then synced back to my iTunes, the play count updates accordingly. Will my play count transfer to my Apple Music library once iTunes is gone? Cause so far I see no option to see play count in Apple Music. Will I have my personal star ratings? Play count is very important to me. My music listening history lies there. I love to see how often I have listened to an album, I love keeping track of that, I love the organizational aspects of iTunes, my ratings, my album art, my playlists...

Before I update my Mac to Catalina, I need proof, evidence, hard confirmation that all of these things will still be there when I make the move. Otherwise I‚Äôm going to leave my system as it is.

Thanks in advance for the help.","[""Apple Music is a streaming subscription service. Music is what used to be called iTunes but with the video, book, and podcast sections pulled out of it. Everything apart from the column browser's removal is the same. Playlists, sorting options, play counts, etc. are all still there. Nothing's being transferred. It's the same app with a fresh coat of paint. If you need hard proof(?!), there are plenty of videos on YouTube."", ""Hey mate, I totally understand where you're coming from and I do it the exact same way. Only major thing that changed is that you're not able to show album artwork in playlists (if you view them as songs) or in the Songs section anymore. Also every playlist resets every settings you may have applied to them to default. And since you talked about iTunes lacking of a lot of material, the update deleted every album artwork and Apple Music looked for it by itself in its own systems. So I guess you may have to find a way to save all your images before you update. May have also been a unique error for me, but I'm not that excited about the loss of iTunes so far to be honest. I think it won't hurt if you wait a few months.""]",2,1.512359506921084,apple_music

Can‚Äôt sync music onto my iPod.,"Recently, I decided to try Apple Music and start adding music that I've been meaning to put on my iPod for a while. But it has NOT been smooth sailing for me. Yesterday I made a post [asking whether I can edit info for songs/albums that are in my iCloud Music Library](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/dfyw05/how_do_i_edit_song_info_in_my_icloud_music_library/), and one person said that I should just empty my iPod Touch 6's music library and resync it with iTunes. So I went into iTunes, turned off ""Sync Music"", synced my iPod, rechecked it, and tried syncing it again. I can't sync my music back in! Everything seems to be on there, but they are now accompanied by the download icon required to be able to listen. The only exceptions are a couple of my more recent iTunes purchases and the four albums I've added with Apple Music.

I tried Google for an answer, and it says that I need to turn off iCloud Music Library. I don't wanna do this. I enjoy listening to my music wherever I go without Internet access being required, but I also wanna be able to add music to my iPod without having to buy any more iTunes Store cards, thus saving me a fortune. Is there any other workaround for this?

I think I have an idea: what if I turn off iCloud Music Library on my iPod, but NOT on my laptop? Then I can just download music within iTunes and then sync it like I've been doing for so long, only this time with Apple Music and not the iTunes Store. Will this work, or does it have to be enabled on *both* devices for my new music to be listenable?","[""I was the person that responded to you yesterday. I might not have been as detailed as I should have. \n\nSince your iCloud Music Library is on, on iTunes and that's the most accurate info that's perfect.

Help with new update - can't transfer music from my macbook to my iPod.,"I have a MacBook. I use it mainly to post on reddit and to manage my huge music collection.  I am not a tech savvy person - my wife had to twist my arm to get me to get an ipod and dump my huge space-occupying CD collection.

So a coupe days ago, I got a notification that some updates were ready. I finally got around to updating my computer yesterday. I didn't realize the entire OS was being replaced, including iTunes. If I had known that, I wouldn't have done it.

I've spent an insane amount of time organizing and adding custom artwork to my tracks. Only about half has shown up. There's a ""loading artwork"" message on the lower left, but it's been there overnight and no artwork has appeared since last night. I can't get it to go away, and I'm afraid to go in and replace the art in case it does finally load and updates over it and then I have to do it *again*.

I tried hooking up my iPod to transfer some music I downloaded yesterday. before the update, I had been doing manual transfers, just clicking on the albums I want to move to the iPod and moving them to iPod area on the left. This doesn't work now. I click on the album, move it to the iPod area on the left, and nothing happens. The music won't transfer. This has me angrier than anything else BECAUSE IT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SOFTWARE.

When I hooked my iPod up, iTunes immediately transferred about fifty copies of various playlists I have on my iTunes, multiple copies of each, and multiple copies of playlists that I had once had on my iTunes but deleted months ago. I ejected my iPod, and now I'm a little afraid to hook it back up.  Then I spent twenty minutes deleting all the playlists.

I want to go back to the previous version, which worked fairly well.  I'm realizing I probably not able to do that, at least not with my current level of tech aptitude.  Is there some trick to transferring music now that I'm not aware of?   Can I hook up my iPod without all the crazy playlists showing up again?

Why did they do this to me?  I just finally had everything exactly the way I wanted it.

Also, who to I complain to?","[""The 'missing artwork' seems to be a common thing in Catalina.

Apple Music library after a month of no subscription,"Hi All!

So, for years, I collected my music via iTunes on pc, listening it on my iPod, iPhone, and since I got a Mac, on that too. So as I thought I'm in the ecosystem, I should join Apple Music. it was awesome, every song from my pc's library been available too on every apple device.after this, my pc died, so every music I had was in the clouds. For two years of subscription, I simply saved my music via Apple Music, instead of getting the mp3 from other sources. Unfortunately I couldn't pay the fee for a month, and my subscription has been canceled, and my whole library disappeared, except those songs that I had the mp3 on my pc back then, and was downloaded either on my iPhone or MacBook. Today I repurchased it as soon as it was possible for me, but I got a message that my library couldn't been refreshed, so I quit, because I don't know if it tried to refresh the Apple Music library from the library with the 4000+ song to the new where I have only 20.

So my question is:

is there a way to safely get back my complete library, which I had until august, somehow?","['One option, go to your Music settings (in the Settings app) and make sure iCloud Music is turned on. \n\nIf that doesn\'t work try contacting Apple Support - chatting or calling them - they are always friendly and will try and help as best as they can. \n\nI will say that Apple does this stupidly ridiculous thing where after a month of not subscribing (and I\'ve heard up to three months sometimes) they trash your music library. So if you miss a payment and wait a month or more to re-subscribe there is a possibility that your music library won\'t be recoverable. \n\nThis sucks for someone like you, for soldiers who have to go away for extended periods of time, same with business people who travel abroad for extended time. Yes Apple, some people have legitimate reasons for ending their subscriptions temporarily - and it\'s absolutely childish to not offer a ""Pause Your Subscription"" option for these people.\n\nWhat\'s crazy is that Apple actually does save some information after you unsubscribe - your likes and dislikes - but they don\'t save the contents of your library. I quit Apple Music a few years ago because I became sick of their awful radio and recommendations, after a year of not using the service I came back because other services didn\'t suit my needs. Upon coming back to AM, none of my library was there (wasn\'t expecting it to be) but I was getting recommendations from bands I was listening to a year prior when I had the service (thus they do save some information).\n\nThe reason Apple trashes your library after a month+ of not subscribing? The looming threat of your library vanishing basically forces users to always be subscribed - thus you\'ll likely never try other streaming services. The downside to this tactic is that someone like you (whose library may be gone forever) will likely switch to a streaming service that doesn\'t trash your music in case you can\'t pay for a month or you have to cancel the service for a short while for other reasons. \n\nThis tactic makes Apple look so unconfident in their own product. It\'s like they don\'t trust that if people try Spotify for a month they will never come back to Apple Music. Whereas if Apple spent more time improving their radio/recommendations they wouldn\'t need to threaten to destroy music libraries because no one would have any reason to move to Spotify at that point anyways. \n\nSorry for the rant. OP I hope you get the problem solved!']",3,4.641398859628373,apple_music

Can I edit genre names?,"I learned earlier this year - much to my dismay - that Apple was finally gonna kill off iTunes to shift focus to Apple Music. At first I was furious; I am far too accustomed to buying and listening to music on my iPod the old fashioned way. But then I took a closer look, and turns out it doesn‚Äôt mean they were gonna shut down the iTunes Store, nor were they gonna take away all the stuff I purchased over the years. They were just gonna move that stuff over to Apple Music. So I decided *maybe* I‚Äôll give their subscription service a try. And as much as it‚Äôs gonna kill me inside to have to pay every month for it, when it comes to tracking down the songs/albums I wanna have it could save me a fortune. Haven‚Äôt gotten around to it yet, but I am thinking about it.

There‚Äôs just one catch, though. Whenever I buy songs from iTunes on my laptop, I usually modify the name of the genre to organize my music a little more neatly before syncing it to my iPod. For example, if I bought a song or album from a-Ha or Tears for Fears, I would change the genre name from ‚ÄúPop‚Äù to ‚ÄúNew Wave‚Äù. Or if I bought a song or album from Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd, I would change it from ‚ÄúRock‚Äù to ‚ÄúClassic Rock‚Äù. I would name more examples based on my tastes, but I think you get the idea.

Can I still do this with Apple Music? And if so, can I do it from my iPod/iPhone or my laptop?","[""Yes you can. Your genres can be organized how you'd like.

"Apple Music on Catalina, a distaster","Since I updated my macOS to Catalina, iTunes is gone and it's only Apple Music, which is a good thing. Many parts of it had become irrelevant, so now it's more clear what is what. But man, what were they thinking before releasing this?

\- When I change metadata of a song, it is loading 15-20 seconds. Before it also took long, like 10 seconds, but it has almost been doubled now.

\- I can't press the + button anymore when I'm adding new songs to my library. It doesn't do anything except loading. I have to click on the menu and then click on 'add to library' until something is happening

\- Not all album artworks are squares, but Apple Music has made them all squares, which fucks up a small portion of my library

\- When I change metadata while I have an album opened, it doesn't change with it. So when for instance I change ""Pet Sounds (2019 remaster)"" to ""Pet Sounds"", it keeps stuck on ""Pet Sounds (2019 remaster)"" but there's nothing in it. To go back to the right album, I have to search again which takes me like 20 seconds extra.

\- The search function has become worse then it was

\- Sometimes songs don't play when I double click on the title. I have to wait until the play triangle appears, click on it, and then it plays

\- Sometimes it just starts loading, when I changed nothing at all. For like 10 seconds.

\- They still haven't fixed the fact that you can't search for <artist + title> only by artist or by title. Not both.

\- They still haven't fixed that some tracks have multiple genres.

\- They still haven't fixed a proper way to display featured artist. Spotify is the only app who does this in a good way.

\- I had a collection of music videos, but since not every music video is on Apple Music I added like half of it myself. These are all gone now. I can find them in the Apple TV app, but there's no possibility to return them to Apple Music.

\- Overall it has become a very very slow app. The main reason I use Apple Music is because I can edit metadata and create an ordered and big library. Spotify is super fast. When searching for a song I immediately have it. I really feel bad about the fact that Apple Music becomes worse with every update, because I love its functions so much. The filtered playlists, the countless options on adding and editing metadata.

Does Anyone on here use both Apple Music and Spotify?,"For the past month and a half, I've been super torn trying to pick between the two services, so I've decided I am just going to use both. My reasoning for using both is that I love a lot of things about both services. 

&#x200B;

Spotify's music discovery and playlists are great. I have discovered so much new music and artists via their playlists and personal playlists such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar. But I don't really like their UI and library management, plus no lyrics, and that's where Apple Music shines for me. It seems like every update, Spotify removes features and never adds anything. Like, Spotify used to have lyrics for example and removed them 3 years ago, promising they'd return shortly but never have.

Spotify has just left a bad taste in my mouth in terms of their insistence to remove features and make their UI worse with each update.

&#x200B;

Apple Music's UI is so clean and organized and Apple respects your music as your personal music library. There's no 10,000 song limit, there's music videos/genres, amazing lyrics feature, light and dark mode, ability to upload your own music, etc. If Apple Music had comparable playlists and discovery features, then Apple Music would be 100% a winner for me.

So what I do is I use Spotify to discover music and browse their playlists, then I transfer these playlists and all of the new music I discover on there over to Apple Music via SongShift, which has always worked wonderfully for me.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else use both? Let me know down below.","['I‚Äôve been using both for several years, for several reasons. \n\nLike everyone else, I find Spotify infinitely better for auto playlists and music discovery. Also, Spotify works with all of my google homes, Apple Music of course does not. For this reason alone, I will be keeping Spotify. \n\nHOWEVER, I mostly prefer the more robust user interface of Apple Music, the fact that it‚Äôs so well Ôøº integrated into my iPhone, but most importantly (to me) it works in my car. (I don‚Äôt have CarPlay, but I can browse my AM library through the interface of my car, which is not possible through Spotify) I can sort by playlist/song/artist etc, and control it all on the vehicle touch screen. This is huge for me. \n\nWhen I hear a new song I like on Spotify, I Shazam it so it auto adds to my AM library. (It adds to the ‚ÄúMy Shazam Tracks‚Äù playlist, which automatically downloads and adds it my AM library) This is also a very slick feature I literally use on a daily/weekly basis.  \n\nFor the reasons listed above, I see enough value in keeping both services for the foreseeable future. I pay for AM family so my wife and kids can use it, and I use a personal Spotify account on my iPhone/iPad which I use for music discovery and casting on google.', 'Same here... the design and sound quality of Apple Music is far superior.

My music library is filled with albums that I collected over the years, many in the 90s that aren't available on any streaming service, so the way Apple Music handles uploaded music is far more important to me than any discovery algorithm.

Uploaded/Matched tracks turned into AM DRM protected tracks at some point,"About half of my library at some point turned into AM DRMed protected (m4p's). The majority of these tracks were indeed my music that I ripped long ago or loaded myself.

History and theory: We added iTunes Match and loaded up our library. At some point after that (few years ago), I completely removed (not deleted) all the tracks and re-downloaded everything to get 256 kbps. I do not know if this was the point that half the library's tracks turned into protected tracks or if it happened later. When AM was released, I signed up for that and cancelled iTunes Match.

I can clearly see in my iTunes folder in Finder that half my tracks are in the ""Apple Music"" folder and the rest are in ""Music"". Many albums are broken in parts where some tracks are protected and some are not.

Has anyone heard of this before or experienced it? Since this happened many years ago, I do not have a full backup of my library, so I'm assuming I am SOL here.","['In the early days of AM, it had its own matching technology. After finding a match a track‚Äôs iCloud status became ‚ÄúApple Music‚Äù. Redownloading matched tracks at the time meant you ended up with the same versions as the AM service had, and that meant DRM‚Äôed music. After a while (and loads of complaints)AM changed the matching technique to the same one present in the Match service. So redownloading tracks from that moment meant downloading DRM-free content. This worked immediately for first time AM users, but for AM- users who had already matched  with old AM-match there wasn‚Äôt an immediate and transparent move to new Match-Match. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it never moved to new match in some scenarios. I hope this kind of explains what happened to your music.

[Discussion] I think the iOS 13 update made some simple functions worse. Let me explain why!,"Let's say you are listening to a new song and you want to add it to your library. Before the update you had a ""+"" button on the lower left corner and it couldn't get easier than that. Now on the lower left corner you have the ""lyrics"" button that I think is a way less useful than the ""add to library"" button. 

Worst thing is that on the opposite side you have another button but it is to see the queue, I suppose that button makes more sense but I find it annoying that when you pull down the ""queue"" button to hide it and continue browsing, after that, if you press the ""now playing"" song, it opens the ""queue"" again. 

Now the ""options"" button: In my opinion the button it is placed in a weird spot and the icon doesn't catch my attention enough to remember to touch it instead of the ""queue"" button. Everytime I want to add a song to my library I press the queue button because I forget that actions is at the ""..."" button.

Now, the last but not least of my complainings is: Why do they moved the ""Shuffle"" and ""Repeat"" buttons. I didn't notice how well they were implemented until they changed it. I know that before the update they were part of the queue too but you just had to pull up the queue to press ""Shuffle"" or ""Repeat"", now you have to touch two times on different parts of the screen to turn on or off those little icons.

What I think is a good idea but needs better implementation was the possibility to rearrange the actions in the options menu. I guess it was an opportunity from Apple to say: ""hey, these are the options, place them how you want so we are not responsible for ruining that too"".

I suppose Apple made those changes maybe to attract new users, but for someone really used to the functionality AM already had, this feel like a step-back. I hope they return to what they were well known for: good UI.

TL;DR: add to library button, shuffle and repeat are not easy to reach as they used to and the new queue is annoying.","['I highly agree', 'The add to library doesn‚Äôt bother me personally, but I agree on the shuffle/repeat and queue part, I much preferred the old way.

I chose Apple Music instead of Spotify today and here's why," I've  had Spotify since 2016 and been using it up until today when I've found  out that a beta version of Apple Music web player is out.

Now,  Spotify offers a great service and the key factor for me is that you  can play it on different devices and use your iPhone as a remote control  for it if you play Spotify through a Mac or a PC.

Also, most of the people I know use Spotify, so seeing what they are listening to is fun and it helps to find new songs.

The search on Spotify, when you write and the results appear instantly is really good, hard to beat that.

BUT!

Apple  is not a conventional company that would go along with the crowd, and I  am talking from a long-term business model perspective. Let me explain -  Apple does not offer a free Apple Music tier; iOS, macOS, watchOS and  everything else is not open source; the phones and computers do not  offer such  customization level as Android or PC might (although it  depends from where you look at it); and the list could go on, but the  basic idea here is that Apple understands the basic model of how America  works and on what foundation was it built on - **there is a price for everything**.

Spotify  does earn money from ads, but most of the money comes from Premium  users and most of the users in free tier are from Europe, while the U.S.  market chose Apple Music, because paying money for a quality service  means that the artists and the developers of the service will continue  making the service even better and artists will continue making great  music. And also, I can still use Spotify for free, while paying my share  to the great people behind Apple and the whole ecosystem.

The  fact that we, Apple users, trust Apple with our privacy, with their  decisions on how the operating system should look like, feel like, what  services are being offered to us and how much the continuity across the  devices brings us joy - that is why we love this company and I do  believe that in the future, in the long run, in the infinite game Apple  will crush everyone.

**tl;dr - The web player of Apple Music helped me to switch; In the long term I think Apple's services will boom.**

P.S.: not a native English speaker, I do apologize for my mistakes.  
P.P.S.: if this does not make any sense, I understand. My mind is racing a little bit.","["">and how much the continuity across the devices brings us joy\n\nAs an Apple Music subscriber I just want to point out the jarring lack of continuity within Apple Music itself. I wish I could go from listening to a song on my iPhone to listening to the same song on my MacBook. Given the leaps and bounds Apple has taken with continuity in pretty much everywhere else in the Apple ecosystem it is crazy to me that they haven't adopted Spotify's continuity for music. \n\nWhile a small part of of me would love to see Apple crush the competition, the majority of me knows that competition is the only way Apple Music will continue to evolve and grow. Apple Music suits my needs, but I still have a lot of gripes about it. There are features that Spotify has that I would love to see on Apple Music:\n\n1. Crossfade\n2. Continuous play\n3. Continuity\n4. Better Recommendations \n5. Daily Mixes\n6. A customizable radio feature (like Spotify's new and awesome radio app)\n\nI am now ardently locked down into Apple Music, so I doubt I will ever switch to another streaming service again. But there is much that Apple needs to add onto their own service. \n\nLike why is crossfade available for iTunes but not the iOS music app? Why does my Pages app have a pointless continuity feature but Apple Music doesn't? Why is there a dedicated radio button in Apple Music but there is no customization (such as making a radio station out of 2 or more songs/bands/albums). \n\nApple Music has only made improvements to their service (outside of the horrendous Now Playing card which gets worse with each update). Their recommendations have been slowly getting better. Dark Mode was #1 on my wish list. Their curated playlists are *phenomenal*. However, they have a long way to go, and I hope that the competition from Spotify will only help Apple improve their own stuff. \n\nI think that Spotify has such a dedicated fan base that Spotify will always be around. Apple Music works great within the Apple Ecosystem, but Android is the most popular operating system in the world right now, and Apple Music doesn't have the same ecosystem benefits on Android as it does on iOS/TVOS/MacOS/WatchOS...so this will always be a hindrance for Apple."", 'I think you‚Äôre right. Apple Music has actually overpassed Spotify in the US I‚Äôd I‚Äôm not mistaken.', 'We‚Äôre glad to have you on board. \n\nI personally chose Apple Music over Spotify because you can still customize things in Apple Music unlike in Spotify. \n\nYou want to add the exact correct genre?

I have a lot of tracks on various CD\'s that are not in publication or not ""popular"" enough to gain a place on any streaming service yet I still enjoy them.  Spotify does not easily provide a means of doing that, and I guess never will since they seem more geared lately to force-feed you content rather than compile your own mix.', 'Damn you just drank all the Apple kool-aid huh lol.

Not to mention the detailed biographies you find at the bottom of most artists‚Äô pages. Not every artist, but for the majority, at least. \n\nI really have come to value all this quality music writing. I don‚Äôt always agree with what they say, but that‚Äôs to be expected. It‚Äôs the thought and effort that counts, not to mention the consistently high quality of the writing itself. \n\nThe last time I used Spotify for any length of time was more than a year ago, but I never saw anything like this on their service.

Removing tracks from library without removing them from playlists.,"I'm a Spotify refugee and switched to Apple Music mainly for the better library management. I'm enjoying the experience so far, but there is one thing that really bugs me.

It's the fact that deleting a song in your library also deletes it in all your playlists.

I like to keep full length albums in my library but add singles & individual tracks to a playlist. I moved my whole library from Spotify and I'd like to clean it, but I'm struggling to find an easy way.

[This Apple Support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206183) says:

>If you have songs in your Library¬†that you want to move to a playlist and remove from iCloud Music Library, you first need to [delete the song from your library](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201323), which will remove it from all playlists. Then, add the song back from the Apple Music catalog and add it just to a playlist.

 This method is very time consuming and got me wondering if there is an easier way. I'm open to any suggestions.

TL;DR: How to move a lot of individual tracks from my library to a separate playlist (without removing them from the playlists when I delete them from my library)?","[""Right now, unfortunately, it can't be done.

How is it possible that after all these years ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreate Station‚Äù are still so bad?,"How is it possible that after all these years ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreate Station‚Äù are still so bad?

I think I signed up for Apple Music like on day one to take advantage of being able to talk to Siri to play music and the Apple Watch to control playing music.

I‚Äôve been wondering for a while how is it possible that after all this time ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù playlists are so bad with Chill Mix in particular being a mix of suicidal songs and oldies 

Today I tried to Create a Station from an upbeat slow tempo song most would call ‚ÄúChill‚Äù and the songs that played as part of the ‚Äústation‚Äù were horrible. 

I remember Pandora, Last.FM, Spotify, you‚Äôd pick a song and start a station and it would be a pretty good mix of songs I‚Äôd like.

In a sense Apple Music is more like a slightly personalized radio station, compared to a fully individual on demand streaming service.\n\nAs to why it‚Äòs still so bad ...

Could anyone who moved from Spotify (particularly after that awful UI update in the summer) give me a rundown on what they like more/less after the change? Thanks,"Planning on changing to AM in January after I get my Wrapped stats because I‚Äôm sick of Spotify‚Äôs shit, would like to know what others have to say to prepare for the switch, thanks in advance","[""Cutting and pasting a recent response I made to a similar question. Will preface this by saying that Spotify is phenomenal at algorithms and recommending songs. I really miss that about the service now that I'm on AM. However, they have completely lost me on their recent Podcast push, their recent UI overhaul, their pathetic 10,000 song library limit, and their awful library management (*that some people think is an improvement - but it's really a way to hold a users hand to not make a large library (which should be up to the user: a streaming company shouldn't force you to not add a lot of albums to your library - great freedom there Spotify /s*). I'm glad that Spotify exists because it pushes other services to improve their own features - and a lot of people really like Spotify (which is awesome because everyone is different and has different needs). I have found that Apple Music, even with some disadvantage, is by far the best music service for me. Anyways, here is my copied post:\n\n\\[i have used Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music extensively over the last year. Dabbled a little in Deezer and Pandora). Currently fully onboard with Apple Music.\n\nPros of Apple Music:\n\n* 100,000 song library limit\n* Apple ecosystem (controlling my AirPods via Apple Watch, uploading bootleg albums from my MacBook that can be played on all my devices, Apple TV playing high quality music videos during a get together, etc)\n* curated playlists. Apple has knocked it out of the park lately with their official playlists - chill, ambient, classical, basically any official Apple playlist is constantly updated giving you so much variety...the playlists seem genuinely put together.\n* I can upload pretty much any amount of my own music - bootleg tracks, local band tracks that aren‚Äôt available via streaming - and once uploaded I can stream them from any device I own.\n* Apple Music Browser player. This is something other services have had for years and years. But Apple finally got on board recently and the web player is by far the nicest I‚Äôve used (in my opinion).\n* Metadata editing. This is a huge one for me. I can edit lyrics, edit what is and isn‚Äôt part of a compilation. I can change the annoying ‚ÄúVarious Artist‚Äù label to whatever artist I want. I can even change album artwork (and I do this often, especially for albums I upload myself).\n* Elton John‚Äôs rocket hour. Beats 1 has some good radio shows, I wish Beats 1 would branch out some Beats 2 and Beats 3 so we could get more dedicated stations (Beats 1 is primarily top-40 and usually rap/pop). I would love to see a couple other stations start that are strictly dedicated to alternative, country, classical.\n* Apple‚Äôs official radio stations are awesome. If you make a station based off of a song or artist the results are hit or miss. But the official stations found under the Radio tab are always spot on for me.\n* the overall UI is my favorite of any streaming service I‚Äôve used. The library system is perfect for people who like collecting albums. If you are a playlist person you have a section for those - (however there is still no way to sort or customize how your playlists are shown). Each genre has an extensive page of playlists, albums, and artists that is updated frequently.\n* searching by lyrics works super well.\n* the new lyrics feature is something I have actually been enjoying thoroughly. Lyrics scroll along as you listen - for me it works for most songs that have lyrics.\n\nCons:\n\n* Spotify has better algorithms for radio and personal playlists. But it isn‚Äôt as noticeable to me these days. All of the pros listed above easily outweighs this.\n* the Now Playing card seems to get dumbed down more and more with each update. Gone are the days where you ‚Äúheart‚Äù or add a song directly from the card. Now you either have to 3Dtouch on the minimized card, or you have to press a tiny button to take you to a list of options where you can choose to add or like a song. Same with the shuffle button. It is just needlessly complicated now, ironically for the sake of simplicity.\n* no continuity. For a company that lauds how seamless their products are they sure are ignoring the glaringly obvious omission of handoff to other devices. If I‚Äôm listening to YMCA on my phone and start using my MacBook, is it so much to ask that I can easily\n\nAnywho, that‚Äôs my take. For my needs, I see that Apple Music has the technological edge in most areas. But for others I can see other services having a technical edge. It just depends on what you want and are happy with as a customer. If you like listening to music as a radio/playlist then you should definitely go with Spotify. If you like library management and a huge library, Apple Music is perfect. If you like music videos, ad-free YouTube, then YouTube Music is what you should choose. Best of luck! It can be hard committing to a service, but if you find something you really like you should absolutely stick with that."", 'I haven‚Äôt use Spotify in a very long tome so I don‚Äôt know any more.

I also love the Siri integration, specially when I‚Äôm driving, but I think Spotify has that too now.\n\nThe only huge thing I miss is being able to block an artist, but I regained smart playlists so that‚Äôs a good trade.']",14,9.32668821229151,apple_music

New to Apple Music," I just switched over to Apple from Samsung and I have a couple questions about Apple Music I am hoping someone can help me with -  


1) When I ask Apple Music to play a specific song, it plays that song and then stops. With YT Music, it would keep playing similar songs by other artists which I liked. Does Apple Music have a feature like this?  


2) When I ask it to play a specific artist, it will pick about 20 random songs from that band and then start over at the beginning instead of just continuing to play through that bands entire library. This is especially annoying when I am driving somewhere nearby and get through just a couple songs.

I have used iTunes forever but never subscribed to Apple Music, using Spotify instead. I had a few playlists that I made on iTunes, with songs that I had imported from CDs over the last 15 years or so. I had also imported these playlists to Spotify.

Also, my library has almost been completely obliterated of all my old music (including all the other playlists) and only the downloads remain. 

My question is, where the fuck is my music?? 

I paid good money and spent hours importing these CDs over the years. Do I need to pay for the subscription to Apple Music in order to have access to my own music again?

Merging iTunes library with iCloud library struggles please help.,"so I got Apple Music and merge my libraries (most of it is music that wasn't purchased through iTunes Store) and turned on the iCloud library to access the music from Apple Music on my library. problem, certain albums decided to change the album artwork which I've picked out on my own to something else. some album covers still fit the artist but others where wildly wrong.

Wife's music is dominating my For You/Radio station,"A long while back, we shared an iTunes library. Everything was on one computer under my account and we sync'd iPods/iPhones to that computer. Then when Apple Music happened, we had a family plan. (Now we have individual plans through Verizon.) For quite some time, she listened to Apple Music on Apple TV, which was signed in as my account. We then got a HomePod and it's set up under her account.

My wife likes Country. I do not. Every week 1/2 or all of my Favorites Mix is her music. My personal radio station is generally better, but once in a while goes into Country mode.

* I cleared out my iTunes library and removed all of her music.
* I reset the play count on all tracks.

* I've been liking my music like crazy.
* I spent a month only listening to shuffle of my library of music.
* When I could, I set my Apple Music preferences for my music and did not include Country.

iPod (classic) shuffle Vs. iOS shuffle.,"TL;DR: started using my iPod classic again. It seems like the iPods shuffle- algorithm is better than iOS‚Äôs In my opinion. I get less back to back songs from the same artist/ same album on the iPods shuffle, than my iPhone‚Äôs. Since the launch of Apple Music, did Apple change the iOS shuffle algorithm? 



My Current library has 1902 songs. All from cds and direct downloads. No actual Apple Music streams. My iPhone and iPod has the same music library synced to them. 

Past few weeks I‚Äôve been listening to my 6.5 gen iPod classic again. Either because the iPod is basically a single purpose device, unlike iOS devices. But It seems like I‚Äôm enjoying my music on shuffle more on my iPod, than I do on iPhone. 

We all have that song(s) that always come on with shuffle that we always skip, but on my iPod it seems like it happens less often than my iPhone. I always get the same ~250 songs I go though with slight variation to the mix on iOS. Like  on my iPod I‚Äôve had times thinking ‚Äúùò•ùò¢ùòÆùòØ ùòê ùò©ùò¢ùò∑ùò¶ùòØ‚Äôùòµ ùò©ùò¶ùò¢ùò≥ùò• ùòµùò©ùò™ùò¥ ùò¥ùò∞ùòØùò® ùò™ùòØ ùòÆùò∞ùòØùòµùò©ùò¥‚Äù. 

I  never just start same current shuffle queue when I listen to music. I always start a new shuffle queue at the beginning of a listening session. I know if I didn‚Äôt restart the queue on my iPhone then I wouldn‚Äôt notice this. But most of you know iOS doesn‚Äôt always remember the queue. 


What do y‚Äôall think about the iPods shuffle algorithm vs. iOS‚Äôs?",['They don‚Äôt really shuffle song to song as much as they jump around the list in batches nowÔøº. How much you like songs also weights them a little bit towards the front of the listÔøº. The iPod doesn‚Äôt have your recent history to do so.'],1,16.339141917408064,apple_music

A Very Negative Experience With Apple Music,"Hi all. I wanted to share an incredibly negative experience I am having with Apple and possibly entertain some advice on any avenues of action I might be able to take. 

Story goes:

I had to get a new debit card, and I was trying to update my billing info in my Apple Music app. The app asked for 2 Factor authentication using a phone number ending in 03. I've never had a phone number ending in 03 in my life, so it seemed as though my account may have been compromised.¬†

I called customer¬†service to try to get access to my account back. Apparently, there is literally no way for me to get access to my account without access to this phone number. I explained that this phone number was clearly either non-existent or in somebody else's possession, but they said there was no other way to verify my¬†identity. I didn't believe them, so I spent nearly an hour on the phone with managers, technical support, etc. It just seemed so archaic and non-sensical that a phone number would be the only possible way to verify an account.

Well, it turns out that it is exactly that non-sensical over at Apple. There's literally nothing they are either able or willing to do.¬†

So, once I had accepted that the account was gone forever, I asked for my purchased music as a download, and I would just make a new account. They said without access to the account that I could not access that music.¬†

This was where I became very upset. It seems as though Apple is holding my property against my will. I told them there were 2 outcomes that would be acceptable to me:  
1) Provide me with downloadable links to all my purchased music.  
2) Issue me a full refund for all my purchased music.¬†  
They said neither was possible. I pleaded, I chastised them, I tried everything, but they wouldn't budge.¬†  
Now I feel as though I shouldn't roll over and let them keep my property against my will. I sent their legal department an email requesting either my property or a refund within 72 hours time. If I don't receive either, I currently plan to file a small claims suit against them. I have plenty of PTO left this year, and its a matter of principle for me now.   


Is there anything else I can do?","[""Why didn't you have 2FA already enabled on your account? If you didn't take the necessary precautions to secure your account, then the blame starts with you."", 'It‚Äôs not your property. You bought a license to the music not the actual music like if you were to buy physical media. Apple is within their rights to rescind that license at their discretion. It‚Äôs in the TOS you and everyone else who uses iTunes agreed to.  You lose access to your account you lose the music licenses associated with it\n\nEdit: this is the case with anything ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù digitally', 'It‚Äôs not your property though. Read the TOS. You pay to have access to it. Say the artist took all their music off Apple. You too would lose the music. At least that‚Äôs been my experience. \n\nApple Music sound quality is horrible anyway.

There's also some songs on there I'd like to manually add from artists that aren't on AM. I can't seem to find a way to do it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, it's driving me nuts :)

Apple Music plays different versions of songs from my library,"I tried googling this but I couldn't find anyone with the exact same problem or there weren't any practical solutions. 

Here's the issue

On my desktop in iTunes I have a large music library that I own outright. I've had these songs for years. 

I attach my iPhone to the desktop and download these songs to the phone. But when listening to music through the iPhone Music app, some of the songs are not the same version that I have on my computer. Most often it's the censored version, but most weirdly one song plays just an instrumental version... 

All parental controls on my are turned off and it's very inconsistent. Like, 1 in 30 explicit songs have the wrong version. 

It's like Apple Music isn't actually loading my actual song file on my phone, and is doing some sort of content match with their music library and giving me those versions. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I've seen some suggestions to delete the song and redownload it, but these songs aren't downloaded from Apple Music. Is there any fix? Like a flag or something that says 'this is not the correct version'","[""Well if you're using Apple Music and iCloud Music Library, not sure how you're physically syncing the music over.\n\nIf you turn on iCloud Music Library on iTunes, it should upload the songs to your library.

Apple Music Library Wont Sync onto new iPhone,"Hello everyone, 

Last Friday I received my new iPhone 11 Pro Max, I set it up using iCloud since I have everything backed up there, and until now my music Library won't sync onto my new phone so I'm stuck with the songs I purchased from iTunes a long time ago. I've tried troubleshooting the issue by:

\- Turning on and off my sync library in the settings

\- Signing out of iTunes and iCloud, and signing back in

\- Force resetting the iPhone 

\- Updating to iOS 13.1 

\- Creating a playlist on my iPhone to try and force sync it 

\- Downloaded songs on Apple Music on my Laptop 

\- Erasing all contents and settings and set the phone up a second time

Music is definitely slower to react when tapping on a song, taking an extra second or two to actually start playing. This is true when using CarPlay, but the lag time is even worse there.

Another bug is that the Up Next music doesn‚Äôt go away after it is played through, so when the playlist of songs you have added to Up Next finishes and you click on another song, the ‚ÄúDo you want to clear Up Next?‚Äù alert will always pop up.

I‚Äôve also noticed that playlists that don‚Äôt have dedicated art and instead have the generic 4-panel album art from the first tracks are all jumbled and don‚Äôt correspond to the actual playlists on the main scroll. When you click the playlist itself, the 4-panel on the inside shows correctly.

What are the prospects for us Windows users?,"The title is a question, but it is gonna be more like sharing an opinion.

I'm currently on a free trial and I feel a little confused. I don't own anything from apple; my only music playing device is a Windows 8.1 laptop, and iTunes runs on it like Civilization V on Pentium IV - slow, laggy, jerky and this all not mentioning bugs and constant memory leaks. Plus - the UI is all messy and unintuitive. The web version doesn't help the picture either: it's surprisingly slow in both Firefox and Chrome and lacks many features. Yes, it's in Beta, things are changing and all that, but seeing all the posts here about dark theme already implemented in Safari and other stuff makes me think that web player is still somewhere at the bottom of their priority list. And these are all technical questions, but their legal practices look strange to me too. See, the country where I live has some obscure laws concerning obscenity: it does prohibit use of it in media, but how does streaming music relate to it is not clear. Yet they seem to have chosen the laziest approach by making explicit songs simply unavailable, or available only in clean versions. Meanwhile Deezer, for example, does just fine without hiding all explicit songs, and so do other services. 

Summing it all up, I'd say that I feel like an uninvited guest at someone else's party. And it's sad, because I kinda like this party: the music quality is good (AAC clearly surpasses MP3 and Ogg Vorbis used by other services), the catalog is decent, having some things that are unavailable on other platforms, and gapless playback is a pleasant feature (only thing that's good in iTunes, I'd say). And it makes me wonder if they really are going to become more open for other platforms and how long is it going to take them, because judging by how things are now, I may very well leave the service by the time my trial ends.","[""I definitely agree the performance is terrible overall. My PC is getting a refresh, but I'm running an i5 4690k overclocked, 24gb RAM, and a ASUS ROG Strix 1070 OC and it runs like trash compared to games I can run at 4k 60fps. The Windows side of things is lacking optimization as iTunes will use up to about 25% CPU depending on its mood, often times spiking and staying there even at idle in the background. It occasionally locks up and freezes as well. They don't really care about anyone not using MacOS or iOS so I get it, but still it is infuriating.

"Apple Music, iTunes, iTunes Match","Several years ago (5ish) I ripped all my CDs to MP3 and eventually imported  into  iTunes.

I'll probably not be leaving Apple Music any time soon.,"So this is just something I wanted to share and it's nothing really important and I don't really know if this is the place to do it.

I used to be a Google Play Music user about more than a year ago. But I'm someone who installs a lot of custom ROMs, and I even keep experimenting on my PC with all kinds of Linux distros. So Google's stupidly strict deauthorization policies caused a lot of problems.

Then I switched to Apple Music because Spotify or YouTube Music wasn't then available in India. I had heard so much about Spotify I was just waiting out for it but boy was it a disappointment. Not only is the UI crappy but they didn't have any Ed Sheeran songs in India. Then came YouTube Music and in the usual Google fashion, they had no clue what to do with it. They still don't and it has a bug that won't let me download songs.

So long story short, I was stuck with Apple Music which I didn't like much because it wasn't available for Linux, and the Android app wasn't as good as the one on my iPad. But now that Apple is really starting to push it with new updates (hello dark mode) and the web app, not to mention the lyrics feature and all, I think I'm gonna stick with it for longer than I expected.","['You lost me at Ed Sheeran.', 'I‚Äôm actually thinking of leaving for Amazon music HD.', 'Apple Music has device limit as well.

"so is the ""For You"" section the most stubborn thing in the world, or am I doing something wrong?","I started using Apple Music about a week ago, and so far so good for the most part.

The issue is not only that the ""Hip-Hop"" and ""R&B"" sections of the ""For You"" tab seem to refuse to respond to my listening habits, it's that Apple Music seem hell bent on recommending me very specific types of artists.

It's just I've done nothing even close to warranting these kinds of suggestions.

I've been telling it to stop suggesting me just about every album that appears on my home page, multiple times a day. I've done it to dozens of albums at this point I'm sure. I've been adding albums that I do like to my library like crazy. I've been liking every track that I can, and adding them both to my library, and to playlists. No luck. Apple is CONVINCED that I need these oddly specific subsets of rap and R&B in my life. I know it's only been a week, but SURELY by this point whatever they use to generate music discovery should have figured out after being told for the 100th time that I'm just not interested in listening to Paul Wall.

I remember using Sathorn too, but I don‚Äôt remember it being as customizable and smooth as Marvis (though the dev has likely updated that app since I‚Äôve used it). I‚Äôve heard good things about Soor, too.\n\nMy history with third party apps usually goes like this: I really like the customization at first, but after a while I return to the Apple Music app because of its stability and it includes all the features I pay for in the service - whereas third party apps usually have a couple bugs and they‚Äôre missing a few key features.']",2,23.599060900509357,apple_music

What made you choose Apple Music over other services that have technological edge? Really struggling what service to keep.,,"['I‚Äôve been using iTunes since 2001 and have curated a pretty vast collection which is on my Mac and now matched in Apple Music. There is no ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù that‚Äôs going to make me want to do this again. I also just happen to prefer Apple Music for reasons.', 'The sound quality and the higher song limit in the library.', 'I need a so-called ""music locker"". I collect various original soundtracks from games, movies, anime etc. and there are no music service in existence that has even a half of what I need. So being able to upload your music and sync it across different devices is essential for me.\n\nThat brings the choice down to 2 services: Google Play Music and Apple Music. GPM is a bit cheaper in my country (Ukraine) and has better library. However, Google basically abandoned the service in favor of YouTube Music that is, mildly put, a disappointing offering. This coupled with deprecation of Inbox earlier this year made be leave most Google services altogether. They seem to have a very short attention span and will give up on anything that is not a mind-blowing success sooner or later.\n\nOne other thing in favor of Apple Music is that iTunes is arguably the best software for organizing your music library and managing metadata. You can drag-and-drop your music to the app, edit metadata somewhat and the files on disk will be structured and renamed appropriately. After that I usually backup the cleaned up lossless version of the album to the cloud (most people don\'t need to do this unless they need a backup in lossless), remove its local copy and use the one automatically uploaded to Apple Music for my daily use across different devices.\n\nThe only thing I don\'t like about Apple Music is their recommendations. After using Pandora and Spotify that seem to know your tastes better than yourself I can\'t help but find Apple\'s effort in this area somewhat pitiful. Which is why I occasionally still use other services for music discovery. But other than that, it\'s really good.', ""‚Ä¢Beats 1\n\n‚Ä¢Apple Watch Integration\n\n‚Ä¢HomePod integration\n\n‚Ä¢Song limit that‚Äôs higher than 10,000. Yes this is a valid argument, have been using am for 2 years and have a library of around 7,500 songs\n\n‚Ä¢Family Account with iCloud library so I always have the songs my brother downloaded on my phone\n\n‚Ä¢more songs (iirc about 10 Million more than Spotify)\n\n‚Ä¢integration with iTunes\n\n‚Ä¢you can easily upload remixes etc. to your music library.\n\nI also use a jailbroken version of Spotify which gives me all the premium features except for offline downloads and if I like a playlist I'll just use Siri shortcuts to transfer it automatically"", '[i have used Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music extensively over the last year. Dabbled a little in Deezer and Pandora). Currently fully onboard with Apple Music.\n\nPros of Apple Music:\n\n- 100,000 song library limit\n\n- Apple ecosystem (controlling my AirPods via Apple Watch, uploading bootleg albums from my MacBook that can be played on all my devices, Apple TV playing high quality music videos during a get together, etc)\n\n- curated playlists. Apple has knocked it out of the park lately with their official playlists - chill, ambient, classical, basically any official Apple playlist is constantly updated giving you so much variety...the playlists seem genuinely put together.\n\n- I can upload pretty much any amount of my own music - bootleg tracks, local band tracks that aren‚Äôt available via streaming - and once uploaded I can stream them from any device I own.\n\n- Apple Music Browser player. This is something other services have had for years and years. But Apple finally got on board recently and the web player is by far the nicest I‚Äôve used (in my opinion).\n\n- Metadata editing. This is a huge one for me. I can edit lyrics, edit what is and isn‚Äôt part of a compilation. I can change the annoying ‚ÄúVarious Artist‚Äù label to whatever artist I want. I can even change album artwork (and I do this often, especially for albums I upload myself).\n\n- Elton John‚Äôs rocket hour. Beats 1 has some good radio shows, I wish Beats 1 would branch out some Beats 2 and Beats 3 so we could get more dedicated stations (Beats 1 is primarily top-40 and usually rap/pop). I would love to see a couple other stations start that are strictly dedicated to alternative, country, classical. \n\n- Apple‚Äôs official radio stations are awesome. If you make a station based off of a song or artist the results are hit or miss. But the official stations found under the Radio tab are always spot on for me.\n\n- the overall UI is my favorite of any streaming service I‚Äôve used. The library system is perfect for people who like collecting albums. If you are a playlist person you have a section for those - (however there is still no way to sort or customize how your playlists are shown). Each genre has an extensive page of playlists, albums, and artists that is updated frequently.\n\n- searching by lyrics works super well. \n\n- the new lyrics feature is something I have actually been enjoying thoroughly. Lyrics scroll along as you listen - for me it works for most songs that have lyrics.\n\nCons:\n\n- Spotify has better algorithms for radio and personal playlists. But it isn‚Äôt as noticeable to me these days. All of the pros listed above easily outweighs this. \n\n- the Now Playing card seems to get dumbed down more and more with each update. Gone are the days where you ‚Äúheart‚Äù or add a song directly from the card. Now you either have to 3Dtouch on the minimized card, or you have to press a tiny button to take you to a list of options where you can choose to add or like a song. Same with the shuffle button. It is just needlessly complicated now, ironically for the sake of simplicity. \n\n- no continuity. For a company that lauds how seamless their products are they sure are ignoring the glaringly obvious omission of handoff to other devices. If I‚Äôm listening to YMCA on my phone and start using my MacBook, is it so much to ask that I can easily \n\nAnywho, that‚Äôs my take. For my needs, I see that Apple Music has the technological edge in most areas. But for others I can see other services having a technical edge. It just depends on what you want and are happy with as a customer. If you like listening to music as a radio/playlist then you should definitely go with Spotify. If you like library management and a huge library, Apple Music is perfect. If you like music videos, ad-free YouTube, then YouTube Music is what you should choose. Best of luck! It can be hard committing to a service, but if you find something you really like you should absolutely stick with that.', ""All my music was in iTunes and I have lots of smart playlists based on song ratings. That's the only reason - overall I dislike the service."", 'Technological edge?', 'As of right now I‚Äôm an iOS user. So in turn I‚Äôm using first party apps.

"[Question] Thinking about switching to Apple Music, but I'm having doubts","For the past 4 years, I have been using Spotify Premium (but I have been using Spotify for almost 8 years now). The thing that I like about Spotify is the significant number of tracks that are available and the possibility of listening to pretty much any device. Also, podcasts.

However, the other day, I was trying to find an album that used to be available Spotify. It isn't anymore. Here on reddit someone said that the artist in question had all of his albums on apple music. So, I started reading about apple music and I'm now considering switching. My main questions are: How easy is to listen in devices that are not apple (this is mostly a problem in my workplace, since all of my other devices are apple)? Are there a lot of playlists made by users? Can you easily find not-well-known artists? People that moved from Spotify to Apple music, what do you like about Apple Music? Lastly, podcasts aren't available on Apple Music right? They would be in iTunes, correct?","['Podcasts are on a podcasts app that Apple makes for iPhone specifically but honestly I hear about a million third party podcasts apps that apparently are better than apple or Spotify. So I‚Äôd just do research on that. \n\nApple Music does have lesser known artists but I would say it‚Äôs not as vast as Spotify cuz Spotify has been out longer but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve found 95% of lesser known artists that I know. \n\nPlaylists are made by apple, artists, and us the customers. You can make public playlists or private ones. \n\nI‚Äôve heard the Apple Music app on Android is dope but I can‚Äôt personally speak for it cuz I‚Äôm using an iPhone. I‚Äôd just recommend trying a free trial and see how you like it. I personally love it and recommend it to everyone including android users.', ""Thought you might want to know this: there's an apple music web player for use on company computers just like spotify \nAnd an android app\n\nSo you should be good in terms of non apple devices"", 'If you are curious about an artist just do a search here:\nhttps://beta.music.apple.com', 'I just made the leap and am happy with the change, especially after Spotify‚Äôs UI change. It took me a while to get comfortable and for Apple Music to really start showing me stuff I was into, but once it caught up I‚Äôve really started liking it. \n\nMy only beef is that I got used to if I followed a playlist on Spotify, the music would say in the playlist UNLESS I added it to my song library. That‚Äôs not the case with Apple Music. If you add a playlist, then the entire playlist goes into your library. So as someone who would randomly shuffle songs I realized I was getting EVERYTHING and didn‚Äôt like that. \n\nTo counter it, I made a favorites playlist and just started adding my favorite songs to that playlist and by default it was going into the library. \n\nAlso, for music discovery, I like listening to my user radio station which is both songs I like and new stuff that‚Äôs similar. I‚Äôve gotten some good new music from that. \n\nMake sure you make a song that you don‚Äôt like or like accordingly and it will help. \n\nfinally, just go ahead and buy SongShift. I snagged it to transfer over my playlist from Spotify and it does it seamlessly.

So a playlist can contain music you own/ripped and music from Apple Music. Also with Apple Music all music gets stored in the Cloud (both owned & Apple Music), so I can access my huge library anywhere. You can airplay or bluetooth it anywhere so I would say your speaker matters more than source device.', 'If only there was a free trial or something...', 'I have both currently, mainly because I have to use iTunes for work - which is annoying AF because just like you called out in your first paragraph, Spotify works on basically any device and isn\'t *tied to the device* like iTunes (and therefore Apple Music) is.  In a pinch, you can even borrow someone else\'s computer/tablet/phone and log out of their Spotify and log in with your own. Can\'t do that with Apple, and that\'s my number one annoyance. \n\nI use Spotify Connect all the time to pass over from my phone to my work computer to my personal computer. Can\'t do that with Apple, either. \n\nPlaylist management is kind of rotten on both platforms, but I find it easier to organize playlists in Spotify and resent that Apple forces some defaults on you - I can\'t reorder any Apple Music playlists that I\'ve ""subscribed"" to - they will only populate in alpha order and I can\'t put them in a folder to hide them. \n\nOn the plus side, for Apple, I appreciate that iTunes follows Apple system preferences in terms of light/dark mode. Spotify are a bunch of assholes for not giving its app a light mode. I often use the app in bright daylight, both on mobile and desktop, and it\'s such a PITA. Thankfully, Apple devices have quick accessibility shortcuts that let me invert my screens when its bright. \n\nForgot to mention - and I hadn\'t really realized this exactly, but when on desktop, I use both/either. For mobile, I can\'t stand Apple Music because of how they force order your playlists - I have to scroll for a year through all the Apple Music Playlists I\'ve added before I can get to my own and maybe it\'s because I\'m used to the Spotify app, but I do not find the Apple Music iOS app all that intuitive/easy to use. \n\ntl;dr I prefer Spotify for most everything except the dark interface.

Is Apple Music expected to launch a lossless option at any point?,Amazon Music did today and I'm sure they'll be pressured to in a few years.,"['I don‚Äôt think so. A majority of people can‚Äôt tell the difference, don‚Äôt have enough cellular bandwidth to stream it, or don‚Äôt use high enough quality headphones to appreciate the difference. A majority of Apple Music consumers are on-the-go and streaming on a mobile device where bandwidth is limited and not consistent. \n\nAAC streaming audio is just good enough where people can enjoy the music without having a poor user experience of constant buffering.', ""I really hope they do. I'm all in on AM and the Apple ecosystem, but every chance I get, I get the Tidal trial and enjoy that beautiful lossless/master track quality for a bit....I'd absolutely pay more for a lossless tier. \n\nI heard a couple of years ago they were considering it, and I'd imagine if Spotify releases their version, that would pretty much force Apple to do the same. Lossless is generally considered a niche group of listeners, but if it's a feature for both Amazon AND Spotify, it's hard not to see the disadvantage to being the odd man out."", 'I hope so. I can definitely tell the difference between AM lossy and ALAC lossless. With that being said I have tried almost all music services and AM 256 AAC seems to be the best to my ear of the lossy compressions.', 'For me a day in I prefer Amazon Music HD,  90 day free trial so I‚Äôll give it longer before deciding if I jump to Amazon.', ""The general consensus is don't get get your hopes up. You need both excellent ears and high end equipment to be able to hear the difference between AAC 256 and lossless. And the people who have both of those is a very small minority of people. There's a lot of audiophiles who claim to be able to tell the difference but it's a placebo effect, they'll fail double blind tests.\n\nApple already does a good job of focusing on the mastering of the music which makes a more impactful difference for all listeners.\n\nThere were rumors that Apple was working on a pair of high end Apple branded headphones. They will for sure be wireless. I can picture Apple releasing a pair of these high end headphones in conjunction with a lossless Apple Music subscription if they can demonstrate higher quality over a wireless connection. Otherwise the only way I see Apple releasing lossless music is if market pressure is great enough to do so.\n\nI think what Amazon is doing is a big deal but it remains to be seen if they'll attract anything beyond a niche market. If people try it and they can't hear the difference they'll abandon ship for lossy music at a cheaper price.\n\nI think Amazon should improve their app. It's not bad right now but it's not on the level of Apple, Spotify, or Play Music. They just barely introduced gapless playback but it's not perfect, you can still hear a small skip. The HD and Ultra HD files will be in FLAC, so hopefully their high end service will have proper gapless playback.\n\nFor the uninitiated, MP3 and AAC do not support gapless playback. Apple and other companies achieve gapless playback by using software engineering tricks that can be complicated. FLAC on the other hand does support gapless playback so it should be easy for Amazon to implement."", 'If they added a 2.5mm balanced jack it would be smaller than a normal headphone jack (to keep phones thin) and appeal to the audiophiles, or just people that want to plug headphones in without taking up the charging port.', 'They would be stupid not too.

[Discussion] Introducing SongSync: My project to emulate Spotify Connect for Apple Music,"Hey everyone! I've heard a lot of complaints from people who switched from Spotify to Apple Music and miss the Connect feature. I'm one of those people and really miss it too, which is why I'm working on a new service called [SongSync](https://www.songsync.online/).

&#x200B;

**What is it?**

Basically Spotify Connect for Apple Music. It will let you view what's playing on your other devices, control playback of other devices, and transfer playback from device to device.

&#x200B;

**How does it work?**

I'm writing a suite of apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows that will run on your devices, talk to the SongSync server, and fetch song updates from the device that is currently playing. The app on the currently playing device sends the info for the currently playing song to the server for the other devices to view. If this is too vague, there's more in-depth info on the [demo page](https://www.songsync.online/demo.html).

&#x200B;

**If I use this, is my data safe?**

Yes! The point I want to get across most is that this service (plus the apps) collects absolutely no data other than what you explicitly give it. The extent of your stored data is: your SongSync username, password, currently playing song (plaintext info), and linked device names. You won't even need to provide an email address.

&#x200B;

**When will I be able to use it?**

It's still in the early stages, and progress is being made faster than I could have imagined. It's not ready to launch yet, but I plan on opening it up for beta testing in the future. I'm incredibly proud of the work I've done so far, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and get some community input. Let me know what you think, and what you'd want to see in a service like this!

If you\'ve synced before, you\'ll have stuff in your iCloud Library already that could mess up things in your current local library when you turn the sync on.  Go to [beta.music.apple.com](https://beta.music.apple.com) (on a PC or Mac) to see your current online copy of the library.

Sine I knew everything was in the cloud now, I went to the storage settings on the phone and just deleted all the local music files.

If iTunes is in the mix, you might make sure the ""Organize Library"" setting is turned off if you\'ve been manually managing your files and tags.\n4. After the first sync, I could still see a lot of files in iTunes that failed to sync.  The Update iCloud Library option helped a little, but it didn\'t do that many each time I tried it.  While troubleshooting another issue, I tuned the sync off and then on again - after that it did a huge pull of the failed files and everything looks like it is synced now.\n\nAlso note that the sync can take a long time.  iTunes said I had 31,000 items in my library at 250GB in size.  It took over 3 days for the first sync to finish.  Then another 2 days for the second sync that fixed the failed uploads.']",3,29.28840117924743,apple_music

Posted on the Apple music forums, but thought I'd also post here.  I had (until recently) the entire Motorhead discography in a playlist on my phone, I went to play through it today and a number of tracks were greyed out.

Checking in Apple Music most of them were still there, so I rebuilt the playlist again.  Unfortunately, one of the albums 'Bastards' is not in Apple music anymore, it IS in Spotify (not a subscriber there, but i checked for this album before posting here) though, I guess the rights for this album were lost by Apple?

So  my question is 2 fold, well, actually 4 fold.

1. Why is it that occasionally i find tracks wont play because they're greyed out, then I have to go and re add them to playlists?
2. Are the missing album rights no longer available to Apple (despite the rest of the discography being there)?
3. Can I copy the cd to iTunes and have that album mixed in with downloaded albums (I think thats what I did originally), or will it simply grey out because Apple Music don't have the rights to it, despite it being ripped in iTunes by me?
4. When adding albums to playlists, why do some albums appear within the playlist in reverse order despite the actual album track order being correct before I added it?

Thanks for any advice..

So yeah, I tried Apple Music when it first came out but couldn't get used to it and didn't really like it compared to Spotify, so stayed with Spotify.

I've got pretty much everything else from Apple - Phone, iPad, Macbook, was looking at a HomePod (Which I know works better with Apple Music),

Is it worth trying it again or is it much the same as it was?

Thanks","[""I can't speak for how it used to be, but I have recently migrated from Spotify to AM.\n\nFor me it seems very different, and was quite jarring at first. Spotify had a good balance between being Playlist focused while supporting individual's libraries. I found discovering music much easier with Playlist Radio and tailored playlists.\n\nAM seems much more album/library based. Instead my workflow changed to listening to albums (and occasionally playtlists) that AM suggests to me in the 'For You' screen. I can then add these to my own playlists and listen to individual song radios, but have lost the playlist radios I used to love.\n\nI don't regret the switch but it seems like a bit of work at first. The more you embrace AM, get used to Loving/disliking songs and creating your own playlists, I think it's a great platform."", ""I just cancelled Spotify and I'm now on Apple Music.... and I am on an Android.

Shared Playlist Missing Songs,"Hi r/AppleMusic!

I have a shared playlist that two of my friends access via Apple Music. Today I discovered that they are getting 17 songs, 55mins of material... when my playlist is 30 songs, 1hr39mins of material!

The playlist consists of songs from an artist where I owned all of their records until their recent (last 2 years). It appears all of those songs from previous years are the ones missing.

I figured it was because I added the songs which were hard-downloaded into my Music app, not the Apple Music version. So i assumed they couldn't access due to that reason. So, I deleted the songs from my playlist, then went thru the Apple Music interface, to the artist's page, to the album, and then added the songs to the playlist... but the Apple Music versions.

This did not fix the problem. I am still seeing all 30 songs, my friends are still seeing 17.

Did I do the right thing? Is there a way to get those songs to actually show up? Despite going through Apple Music's interface, does it still default to my hard-downloaded versions? 

Lastly... how often should my playlist ""update""? As in... is it instantaneous for my friends when I make a change? Because it seemed there was a huge delay.

Merging iTunes Library to Apple Music time,"I'm hoping someone who has gone through the process of merging their iTunes Library with Apple Music can give me some perspective.  

I started the process over 24 hours ago and it seems like it is still working on it (iTunes using 40-50% CPU, doesn't seem hung or anything).  In iTunes, the Activity icon is spinning and it says it is ""Gathering information about your iTunes library"".  The progress circle looks about 90% full, but I think it's been that way for at least 16 of the 24 hours.  How long has this taken for other people?  I understand that this could take a while, and I can wait, but I just want to make sure something isn't wrong and that I shouldn't start over.  

iTunes says there are 31,184 items in the library using 249.58 GB.","['I\'ve turned on iCloud Music Library about an hour ago, and now the activity says ""Uploading to iCloud Music Library"". Some of my songs got ""Matched"" status, while some (even from the same album) are ""Waiting"".\n\nBut the weird part is, it says uploading (as of this writing) ""xxx of 2300+"" songs, and it keeps counting up, while my library only consist of about 1500 songs (as reported by iTunes from the status bar at the bottom)\n\nAlso, another weird part. I have a huge Beatles collection, consisting both the mono version (if available) and the stereo version (and some even have 2 separate stereo version).

2. If the music is from someone who already has an artist page, will the songs/albums I uploaded appear there? Similarly, if the artist isn't on Apple Music, will a *non-public* artist page be ""created""? How do I go about accessing the ones I uploaded?

3. Has anyone tried uploading MP3 or AAC files? Did you have any success? Were the files accepted? I've seen Apple's support page stating these formats are not supported, but some people claim to have done it successfully.

4. Out of curiosity for those who are OCD about metadata or tags, do you complete all details for the tracks you upload (for instance, do you list all the writers, label and so on, or just the artist/album artist, album, year released, genre, track number, title)?

Thank you so much for all your help.","[""1. Yes, your files are uploaded to the cloud, and you can stream them or download them to any device. You do not need to download them locally to listen to them.\n2. The music you upload (including songs from an artist who already has an artist page) will appear in your library under that artists name. I have some Beatles bootlegs not found on Apple Music, so I upload those files and they show up across all my devices under The Beatles name in my library - these uploaded files can only be seen from your music library (you cannot see these uploaded files on their official Apple Music page).\n3. I have uploaded MP3s and I think AAC files and they work just fine. If you can't get it to work you can convert your files in iTunes (they should have a format that will work for Apple Music). But you honestly shouldn't need to convert anything.\n4. I complete the details for what matters to me - so the album year, the track numbering, I will include notes for some bootlegs (who played the piano, who produced the track, or other insider info). I also change artwork for certain albums. Since you're new to Apple Music, you might find it interesting to know that you can actually change the artwork for any album in your library (including any album you add from Apple Music).\n\nI absolutely love Apple Music for the ability to upload my own tracks. I, too, have some friends who make some great music who never made it big, but I love listening to their stuff often, so being able to stream their music from my Apple Music app is one huge reason I'll stick with Apple Music.\n\nIf you have any other questions, fire away! I have come to really love Apple Music in the last couple of months. iOS 13 makes it even better.\n\nEdits for horrible grammar."", 'For number 3: Yes. MP3 and AAC files that can\'t be matched will indeed be uploaded to your library as they are.

Apple Music's Favorites Mix is pretty horrible,"EDIT: Title should be New Music Mix not Favorites Mix.

Hello!

So I thought today that I should check out what does Apple Music's New Music Mix have for me and I was pretty disappointed to say the least.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jwvyyzto6sk31.jpg

From 21 songs:

3 songs from Dino Skatepark

3 songs from Tonio Blu

3 songs from Damfmastermind

&#x200B;

They're pretty far from my taste and what I've been listening to.

EDIT: The issue here is not only bad recommendations but that the 3 songs from those same artists are even from the same album.","['The good news is, through curation (loving/disliking) your mixes will get better over time. One thing that immensely helped my curation was making a Smart playlist of my ""loved"" songs - I\'m so much more inclined to click that heart if I have a playlist where I can view and listen to every song I have loved. This is something that comes standard with most other streaming services, shame that you need iTunes for it to work on Apple Music.\n\nThe bad news is that Apple releases these lackluster playlists only on a weekly basis - so after an afternoon of listening to your favorites/chill/new music playlist, and after skipping and disliking a lot of songs, you have to wait 7 days for the next playlist to show up. At which point you just lose interest because you know it\'ll probably a disappointment anyways.\n\nI wish Apple would switch to daily mixes (like Spotify has) - even if they are garbage at first, I think after a week of liking/disliking that Apple would have a much better understanding of one\'s tastes...and would be far better at curating the ""For You"" page subsequently. \n\nHonestly I rarely listen to these mixes anymore because they just aren\'t that interesting to me. I find the personal radio station is much better (because it mixes both discovery and your favorite tracks into one endless radio station). Unfortunately you have to have Siri activate it whenever you use it. Apple Music really should have a pinned ""Personal Radio Station"" toggle at the top of the ""Radio"" page or next to all the personal playlists on the ""For You"" page.', '‚ÄúHey Siri, I don‚Äôt like this song‚Äù', '[deleted]', ""Favorites (thread title) vs. New Music (what you're actually talking about). \n\nFavorites is based on your taste. New Music is taste adjacent.\n\nI rarely if ever listen to the New Music list, although it does at least keep things to the main genres I listen to on AM.\n\nThe Favorites mix is pretty solid at pulling songs by artists I like and not always songs that I've marked as liked.\n\nSpotify still has it over AM in terms of algos that pull together random playlists. But neither is good at blending genres."", 'You have to keep liking and unliking songs and eventually it will fall into place.', 'Frankly, just because the recommendation of Apple Music New Music Mix are so bad, I still pay for Spotify. I have AM for years and still get most of the songs outside my taste.

Realising why I‚Äôll never use Spotify. Again.,"So I‚Äôve recently moved to the US from the UK and have had to cancel all my Apple subscriptions to be able to transfer across. In the meantime while I wait for a debit card to be able to restart my Apple Music sub I‚Äôve reverted to using Spotify (my wife has an account).

I used to be a Spotify customer and so had some playlists saved. Decided to hit download on a few and use it for the next few days. I leave for work and hit play. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt sound like the song I downloaded, oh its a cover of the song, skip track, next one is a cover, skip track this time its a ringtone of the track‚Äù

Seriously, I had this issue in the past which ultimately led me to move to Apple Music but honestly this must be a joke. How does this even happen? I completely get that agreements change and at times these companies (even Apple) lose the right to be able to allow streaming of certain songs, but we are talking 4 out of 10 songs!! This isn‚Äôt even unknown or underground bands. Big chart like hits.

Anyone else have this issue? I‚Äôve not had it happen once on Apple Music.  Spotify is a joke, for all their playlists and their playlists aren‚Äôt brilliant, they really are miles behind the experience I expect from AM.","['What you mention is something I experienced first hand using Spotify and what made me ultimately cancel my subscriptions - cover songs. As an example, I used a Spotify ""Boy Bands"" playlist. Instead of hearing things like the Backstreet Boys, N-Sync, Boyz-to-Men, etc, the playlist consisted of nothing but cover bands or groups doing the songs.\n\nSay what you will about Apple Music, it does not do that. You get what you ask for, not some weird cover/sound-alike group doing major hits.', ""Yeah I never had to redownload playlists but there are a few songs I can find on Apple Music that aren't on Spotify, or there's cover songs only. I was curious how that worked and if AM just snags songs exclusively for a few months at a time or if it's just a Spotify issue or what. \n\nLeast they let you redownload playlists at any time, not sure how AM works but I think it just deletes your playlists after a few months which sucks. I don't have AM right now I wonder if there's any way to manually save them as backups every now and then for reimporting later if you know you're gonna take a longer break.""]",2,40.94282247721321,apple_music
