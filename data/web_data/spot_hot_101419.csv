Spotify has been literally fucking broken lately,"It constantly says I'm offline when I am connected to the internet and I have to reset the app to fix it
Sometimes I will have only offline search results for like a full 24 hours even though the app let's me visit artist profiles and doesn't say I'm offline

Finally, why'd they remove the ability to remove songs you dislike from albums?

Following a Daily Mix... what happens when they update?,"I recently noticed you could follow your Daily Mixes and they show up in your library as playlists. It looks like as songs update in the Daily Mix they also update in your library, so this seems sort of like a shortcut to that mix. 

Just wondering if anybody knows what happens when a followed Daily Mix is changed significantly... sometimes my listening habits change and I ""lose"" a genre for a while. I was hoping following the Daily Mixes might fix this, but if the songs are updating in a followed mix I'm worried it won't help that problem at all.

Spotify [says](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/made-for-you-playlists/) ""Select 'heart' on a playlist to save it. This means you can always find it in Your Library, under Playlists and it will continue to update there."" (I'm assuming they mean ""follow"" not the heart icon.)

Anybody insights?",0,0,2.4067922199324325,spotify

Spotify should have a Mixtape and Bootleg section,"Some HH artists spotify page are a complete mess, full of releases that have, in my opinion, nothing to do here.

Bone Thugs is another good example with bootlegs, solo albums that should be in the solo artiste page, Bone Brothers albums that should be in... well Bone Brothers page, clean and explicit albums appears twice but no album has the explicit lyrics logo...

Wu-Tang ? 15 albums are listed and only half are really related to the band and the other half should be in the Compilation section below.

Spotify making changes without listening users,"I'm the only one tired of Spotify unnecessary changes?
In the last few months Spotify have been changing the app, mostly removing functions or replacing the existing ones. I understand they need to innovate their app and bring new futures but most of the changes are just unnecessary and pisses of users.

A few weeks ago they removed the Daily Mix playlists, that pissed almost everybody and then after the users start complain they bring it back but now they are limited Playlists and because that wasn't enough they changed the algorithm so all my 6 playlist sound almost the same which is so annoying because they picked up something that was already good and made it bad. Users keep complain about the changes but feels like they didn't care anymore.

Other change for example is the ""Also appears on"" menu, where it used to show singles and albums the artist was featured in, but they just removed it without an explanation. And the thing is the menu wasn't causing any problems on the app and many users used it, people keep complaining about the changes but Spotify does nothing, they just come to the forum with their pre-made text saying they appreciate your review and they are working on it, but they just don't care. 🤦🏻‍♂️😤

I did this post because I wanted to know your opinions about that, not because a post on Reddit will change Spotify app but just wanted to talk about it.","['Yup, you’re the only one.

"The ""Discover Weekly"" feature needs an overhaul...","30 new songs per week, that's great, right? However, atleast 15 of those 30 songs are the same songs you already have on your playlist, just a slightly different version. Then 5 other songs might be in a foreign language (german in my case), although I never listen to german music! And then you are left with 10 new songs per week, and atleast half of these songs are crap, so you are left with potentially 5 good songs for the week. 

My main problem with Discover Weekly, is that atleast 15/30 are rehashed songs I already have in my playlist.","['Mine is generally pretty good for me. I\'ll listen to it when doing homework and find myself adding a couple songs to my liked list each week. I still listen to the playlist through out the week, I just add the few that really jump out at me. I do find that if I add a lot of music, or listen to a specific genre very heavily the next week the playlist will be heavily skewed to that genre. Are you using the ""I don\'t like this song/artist"" button? Maybe it\'ll help beat your playlist back into shape and stop playing songs in a different language.', ""I actually look forward to a new Discover Weekly playlist each week.  It's certainly not perfect and there are often some questionable songs but I can live with how it currently works."", ""I don't really find songs I like in Discover Weekly, just in Release Radar."", ""My Discover Weekly doesn't represent my actual taste in music for some reason. I listen to about 60% metalcore and 40% hiphop/indierock/pop and about 25/30 songs in my DW are death metal, which I have never and will never listen to? It's just strange."", 'This feature will never be perfect for everyone. I find it pretty useful. If I discover and add 2-3 songs a week that I really like im ok with it personally', ' Not even close. My discover weekly has always been good to great for me', 'Mine used to be really good. Like I would have known maybe one band on it but now it’s over 50% songs that I already have saved or in a playlist', 'As someone who has a wide range of music tastes, I love it. I agree that some weeks are misses but plenty more are hits. The truth is that an algorithm is not going to get it right every time. The most I\'ve done to make sure that my Discover \'works\' for me is that I use the ""I don\'t like this artist/song"" button as often as possible. I feel like it helps. And, sometimes, I take a break from it for like two weeks. Sometimes, letting the algorithm see the music I add on my own for two weeks seems to help it find better choices.\n\nBut that\'s just me...', 'I never get familiar/already known songs in my DW. It\'s always new music. And it\'s never any ""world"" or foreign music - may be produced by someone foreign but is always in-line with what I like genre-wise. The 30 songs I get each week are usually pretty good, maybe 5-10 of them I don\'t like, and the rest I do.\n\nMaybe it depends on how you\'re using Spotify. The more you input you give them, the more accurate your DW will be. I\'ve used Spotify daily for the last few years, and it has 9k songs I like saved, hundreds of playlists I like saved, and hundreds of artists and playlists followed I like. So maybe that matters.', 'The thing is, you need to put a little effort into working WITH Discover Weekly in order to truly optimize it. Do you actively LIKE or DISLIKE each and every single one of those 30 songs on your DW? Because that will help a lot quicker establish what Spotify’s algorithm should look fore, then you should stop getting songs you already listen to. It might take a few weeks to really make a difference, but it ABSOLUTELY will.']",11,4.961583888009191,spotify

What are the best ways to discover music?,"I've been using spotify constantly for over a year now and decided to wipe my Liked Songs library which had over 2000 songs in it. Mainly because I've got tired of hearing the same songs that I've been listening for God knows how many years. And some songs were there just because I liked them back in the day but nowadays don't really click. 

I've been a spotify user for maybe 4 years, but had a tendency to change accounts, as I've said current one has a memory and taste of around one year. 

My plan is just to go wherever spotify takes me and build the library from there. I understand that daily mixes will still be filled with songs that I've got rid of, but I don't mind adding some of them back.

Anyway... Any tips on discovering new music? Thanks.","['When I get bored to listen my playlists. I usually listen real radio.

In these cases there is code on the Spotify end that earnestly tries to figure out which artist by that name is meant. It usually works!

Strange behavior suggesting hijacking Spotify,"To start off: I'm very secure savvy overall, I do not use Facebook - my email is 100% secure and my password are all randomly generated regardless of what platform I'm using.  I've been using Spotify for a while, but only recently upgraded to premium. Almost within a week my account started displaying strange behavior of quitting songs in the middle, pausing or playing random tracks I had never heard of. It started playing tracks from an account named ""stuart.piker"". I've no idea who this individual is, and seeing their username appears to be their name I'm quite convinced I've never even known this person.

Naturally I generated a new password, changed the old and tried again. Initially this was to no avail, Stuart would just take control again and play arbitrary songs. So I decided to research this issue, and it appears to be rather common and widespread with Spotify. I would deem the odds of someone having actually hijacked my account about zero, unless there has been a leak on Spotify's behalf. A few hours ago I discovered a button called ""private session"", which would, according to the Spotify manual, prevent it from sharing information with Facebook(not sure why this wouldn't be the default setting in first place). Upon enabling this I no longer experienced Stuart being a clown and going about listening to whatever he pleased. This has however only been a few hours, so perhaps Stuart himself is panicking with the same issue I'm experiencing on his end.

I don't want to throw about accusations, but I think there might be something very wrong with the Spotify service. This is the first time in any application ever anything similar to this happened to me.","[""I'd say you were hacked.  BTW no email is 100% secure.

PLEASE HELP How to sort lists of playlists on Chromebook or Phone,"Hey, so I'm pulling my hair out. I recently switched from Google Play Music to Spotify so that I can easily control all of my devices and stereo that's connected to an old laptop.  That way my phone or chromebook are my remote.

But I'm not finding the most simple and basic thing that I need. To sort my list of playlists alphabetically.  When Im trying to add new music to various playlists or play various playlists, it's needlessly frustrating.

In Google Play or Apple Music you press a couple buttons to do this.

On teh Googlez it sounds like if I had the Windows Application I could do this, but I only have my Chromebook, an outdated windows laptop (that Spotify wont install on because it's too old) and my S9.

Am I overlooking some simple button? Or is this real not even an option in spotify? I read through the 3rd party apps list, but didn't find one that accomplishes this simple task.

Bluetooth problems since Android 10,"Ever since I updated to Android 10 on my Pixel 3 I've had issues with playback over Bluetooth connection. Instead of dipping the volume down for a notification like it used to (although it hasn't done that since I got this phone) it pauses for a second. But now when it resumes after the notification sound it usually fails to output sound to the car. It keeps playing, but no sound over Bluetooth. A quick pause, a two second wait, and pushing play again *usually* solves the problem, but not always. Sometimes I have to force quit the app.
Notifications from Facebook and Lyft Driver apps nearly always do it, but Messenger and Android Messages almost never do. I have battery optimization off already, and I've cleared my cache and updated to the latest version. Amazon Music doesn't have this issue either.
