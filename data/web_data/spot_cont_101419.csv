Spotify has done this while always keeping its service free for everyone to use. This is not your average evil corporation milking money from its customers while stroking the egos of its providers.\n\nLet's be honest, if you were to pay for every track/album in your 10k playlist(s) you would most likely not be able to afford having such a huge music library in the first place. \n\nI've had a lot of issues with features being removed from the desktop-client myself, but I always come back to this conclusion that in its current state, Spotify is still one of the good guys representing the interests of us music listeners in a world of big music labels who couldn't care less how much you have to spend to access their music.

Spotify for PC is Hot Garbage,"Can we please talk about how terrible the Spotify app runs on PC?

I don't think I've come across a worse functioning app, especially one that is paid for with a regular subscription. To be clear my laptop isn't amazing, but I do quite a bit of video editing and gaming on it. It should be perfectly capable of opening Spotify in a decent amount of time.

It frustrates me every single time I open the damn program. I can't be the only one can I? Where is all this subscription money going? It can't be going to engineers.","[""That..... Doesn't happen for me?\nI just open it and hit play. In just 10 secconds im listening."", ""I agree with you and know exactly what you mean. It seems inconsistent. There are folks here that have no issues with it, and then there are folks here like you and me that have to battle how shitty the software is on my desktop. I have to uninstall Spotify every few weeks and reinstall it, otherwise what you described occurs. Takes forever loading it up, takes forever to select a playlist to play, takes forever to do anything. I have a 150/150 fiber connection and a brand new computer with a great SSD and CPU as well...so it's not on my end. \n\nMy theory is that it's because my Spotify library is large, and because I have a lot of playlists and artists/playlists followed. I hit the song limit (which is the smallest library size in the entire industry, 5x smaller than the dying Google music even, and 10x smaller than either Apple or Amazon music...), and I have hundreds of playlists followed or made over the last 5-7 years. \n\nSucks to have my own music library dependent on the server speed of Spotify , one of the downsides of streaming for sure, beyond the arbitrary and very annoying library size limit. My own fast internet and computer don't matter, when your music library functioning or not is based on the competence of Spotify's server management. As a Spotify premium user of 5+ years, I'm slowly moving all my stuff over to Apple, so won't have to deal with it too much longer at least. I love the Spotify UI, seamless switching between devices, use with Google maps, and most of all the new music algorithm and new reccs each week for new tunes. But it's more frustrating than anything these days, since I can't add any of that new music to my library anymore. \n\nYes, I just make/use playlists instead, but if every new playlist or artist followed or playlist grown slows down my Spotify even more, well it just isn't really a good workaround. Would be nice to just add music to my library...and yes, I do regularly delete music (even if I wouldn't otherwise) to make room. But it's a losing battle ultimately, and annoying enough to start moving playlists and usage elsewhere. So I have been migrating everything away, though I don't really want to. Just has pushed me away after all these years. Great for finding new music. Not great for actually managing and listening to it, like at all. On desktop at least. The app works fine usually, even if still slow af to load playlists often (on a Note9). Seems once your library gets too big over the years, maybe it just struggles hard at that point. Like an end game to using the software almost - cant add any new music, and the software struggles to do basic things a lot more after X years of accumulated use. Plus any offline music integration function for music files already on your computer is still terrible, a decade later (purposefully I'm sure).\n\nP.S. - The fact that you can't navigate and listen to your own music library on Spotify by Genre, like you can in every other music library software, drives me mad too. Artist, Album, Song, GENRE. Every competitor to Spotify has this very basic feature, to sort through and listen to and navigate your library by genre is a fundamental aspect of a music service, and it's super shitty of them to exclude such purposefully (it's one of the most/highest voted feature requests on their forum feedback site)."", 'Pro tip: start your spotify app then close it via task manager and open it again.

Spotify is the worse piece of software on my Android and on my laptop,"So, hear me out. The service itself is alright, probably the best, but everything else is terrible. Do you need examples?

It turns out that Spotify is this tiny puny company (sarcasm) without resources and as such can't create proper native apps on any platform, so it has to use the notoriously lightweight (sarcasm) Chromium framework to share as much code as possible between platforms.

What does this mean? Well, after version 1.0, regardless if you use a Mac or Windows, you will see these ""helper"" processes eating hundreds and hundreds of MB of RAM and the occasional 98% of CPU. This can happen to every single user, regardless if it has happened to you this month or not. For comparison, Windows freaking XP ran fine on my desktop with 256MB of RAM, so no matter one someone might say, this ""chromium framework"" BS results on a fat app with lots of overhead. It's poor and shitty and probably implemented so they could fire/not hire any more programmers and cut costs a bit more.

If you want to do this, why not using webkit? Can anyone enlighten me? I'm not even going to ask for proper native apps.

To make things better, **EVERYONE** has this stupid and inexcusable bug where if you are playing songs from your saved artists or albums, the music will always default to the first song, so you can't select the song that you want. This bug is so pathetic for a company that only does this service, that anyone has to think that this was made on purpose to fuck with free users.

Remember when spotify was enjoyable and lightweight on any sort of devices? Nowadays you kind of need an A10-fusion device and to stay connect to the charger even on our laptops at all times...

This is also why we must hurry for them to transition their disgusting flash-based webplayer to HTML5. Web apps belong in tabs.

I can barely stand Spotify anymore,"Right now, the only thing still positive about spotify is the ease of adding individual songs to playlists, and that they haven’t yet removed the feature of importing local songs (but even that is fucked sometimes, not loading my PC’s music folder). 

I’ve paid for the service for 2 years, and had an account since the start as one of the first invitational accounts, meaning I used it free without ads until they changed the policy. But with the update early this year that changed the whole UI to some god forsaken hipster mobile appearance and dumbed down almost all useful features (double-clicking a playlist to play random song from it no longer works), I’m not sure I want to continue supporting this once legendary application from my motherland.

They removed third-party apps, the Spotify client for Windows is horrendously slow, even when it’s been open and playing for hours (if minimized it takes 5-10 seconds to go fullscreen), the mobile app is so counter-intuitive I want to scream when trying to get to my playlists, and playlist sorting is not what it used to be. They removed starring songs too. There’s way too much empty space, and you can’t even resize columns of playlists (Song Title, Artist, Album, Duration, and Date Added) anymore. 

In June they changed the warm green color of most elements to a puke-y neon green. Since then I’ve been struggling to really like it.

Let's try to find some points, which qualify a ""good"", up-vote-worthy playlist and what disqualifies a playlist, ok?

* full-album-playlists == bad
    * exception: complete Diskography-playlists for artists /w more than one project

* playlists /w artist-blocks (several songs by the same artist / band in a row) == bad

* **too much** switching between themes/genres == bad (via [Rocket_AU](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1l03b2/lets_talk_about_good_bad_playlists/cbuidtx))

Why Spotify is superior in comparison to Apple Music,"Most of you probably already know how much Apple Music sucks atm, but here are my complaints from trying the 3 month trial (Iphone):

1. Apple Music lacks the on/off shuffle button function that spotify has. This creates an issue where you cant pick a song from a large playlist and have the playlist continue in order from there, or it just auto-shuffles. For this to happen, you need to click ""play"" at the top and SKIP EVERY SONG till you reach yours, and then it continues in order. Very infuriating for large playlists.
2. Apple Music lacks a playlist search function, so somehow if I want to play a specific song in a large playlist of say 500+ songs....I can't basically, it's impossible to find manually.
3. I could download my 700+ playlist and still have plenty of space on my 16gb iphone when I used spotify, with Apple Music it won't download over half of that. Why?

In conclusion, at this point in time Apple Music is useless when it comes to managing large playlists. It's many flaws and lack of simple features are ridiculous.","['For 1 at least, you have to swipe up to find the shuffle and queue options...2 is valid, and 3 seems like a bug\n\nEDIT: here’s the button https://imgur.com/a/hygFLPE', '1.

Spotify doesn't deserve my money until they fix these issues 😡,"I'm really mad at Spotify. They could be so much better than their competitors if they didn't take stupid decisions.

- Why don't they allow us to ban or at least dislike songs/artists that we don't like? 
This has been mentioned thousands of time like in this [thread](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Block-Hide-Blacklist-tracks-or-artists/idi-p/22389) (closed!)
I know they added this feature to the discovery weekly playlist but it's not enough. Stop forcing me to listen to artists I don't like. Stop wasting my time making me skip music I hate and giving money to those artists.


- The second issue is the shitty radio. Still plays the same 5 bands over and over. Similarly, it's been mentioned thousands of times like [there](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/quot-Ban-quot-artist-from-radio/idi-p/292576)
I've actually changed my account country to Thailand since I moved there. Before it was set to France and I hated being forced to listen to french songs. Now I don't have the radio feature anymore (not yet available here for some reasons) but I don't miss it since it's terrible.


Also pretty much everybody seems to say the shuffle button keeps on repeating the same songs. I've read that sorting them by song name or toggling the repeat button off fixes the issue but I haven't tested it much.

Oh and I won't even mention the Family plan being restricted to people living in the same freaking household (!!) I don't even live in the same country 😞

","['For me, Spotify needs two things to be the king. \n\n1. Option to upload your own songs to their cloud (like Google Music and bunch of others). I own a bunch of songs that are not available on Spotify and I\'d like them available on every device.\n\n2. Expand their availability to other countries. I find it ridiculous that Apple Music offers their services to over 115 countries, Deezer is nearing 200, but the ""king"" is available in 23.', ""I feel like people are upvoting this just to stick it to Apple when, in reality, this is just blogspam advertising for this guy's site. "", 'I switched to Apple Music because of Smart Playlists. All ""loved"" tracks that haven\'t been played in two weeks. Boom.\n\nAlso, most of my music listening is in the car, and controlling everything with Siri is great.\n\nBUT: If Spotify gets smart playlists going and Siri API opens up, I\'m back with Spotify.', ""Apple has never made good services, hello MobileMe, so I feel this is no different. Apple excels at making hardware that works perfectly with software, like battery optimisations. It doesn't make great stand alone software, its just not part of their culture. \n\nMost of the problems I have seen from people centre around the integration of Apple Music with their existing iTunes libraries. Merging databases is hard, especially when one of those databases has been around for many years and seen many changes, including presumably the addition and removal of various metadata fields. Spotify benefits from having no legacy like this to deal with. \n\nI've been using Spotify for over 2 years as a premium subscriber and while it obviously has its problems, it always has what I want when I want it. I have a couple of playlists which I subscribe to for new music and whenever a new album comes out it generally is available the day it is released. The discover weekly playlist they recently launched has also been awesome."", ""Tried it, I really wanted to like it because I have an Iphone and a Macbook air, the integration should be there and it should be far better but it simply isn't. It feels more empty and broken, there are tons of bugs and the service as a whole is just a bit underwhelming overall. \n\nI've cancelled and I'm back to Spotify where I'll stay unless there are huge changes. Spotify has so many killer features (being able to ChromeCast the web player to my TV for example) that I feel like Apple Music can't even compete."", ""On a similar note, how do you feel about Google music vs Spotify? I can't use Spotify at work so I pay for gmusic, but I can play Spotify from my phone if it's that much better"", ""Even if it's mostly opinion, you're wrong about one thing. Those radio shows are later turned in to playlists that you can listen to. You can access those playlists curated by Dr. Dre and all the other radio hosts."", 'I quit Spotify when they turned their desktop client into unusable shit.\n\n-G.', ""Apple music isn't as good as a service that's been updated and refined for 7 years.....rah rah 20000th post about it rah rah. \n\nJesus it's brand new and basically identical as something that's been working on it for nearly a decade. These posts are beyond tired and old. ""]",44,1517.437068057118,spotify
"Spotify free users - how interested would you be in an ad ""blocker""?","I wrote a little application that hooks onto some win32 functions in order to see what's playing in Spotify. If a known ad is detected as playing, it will bring Spotify's individual master volume down to 5% and play elevator music at normal volume for the duration of the ad. :) Is anyone else interested in using it? I made it last night in a couple hours, so there's probably a bug or three. If there is some interest I'll do some more testing with it and then release it here.

"Changing ""Your Songs"" to playlist is actually changing it back to its original state","Most of you probably don't even remember but a while back in 2015 and earlier ""Your Songs"" where actually playlist. Also the hearth we are clicking on to save a song used to be star and thus the playlist was called ""Starred"". Here is very old [screenshot](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/wszluvccoba1mj44kp8d.jpg) from PC client.

What I am trying to say is, that when Spotify got rid of Starred playlist and made its own ""Your Songs"" tab we know today, people were hating it, complaining, asking for changing it back. Four years later their prayers were answered and you know what, people are complaining again. 

Bottom line is you guys will get used to it. And the change is good, it makes sense. You can finally share your saved songs. You can work with them as you can work with any other playlist, and the Spotify offers much more options to do all kind of stuff with playlists. Changing covers, descriptions, sharing them, you can decide whether to make your saved songs public or not, and you can use all third party apps working with playlists (if you don't know about them, [check this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/95ga27/list_of_spotify_stats_websites_and_not_just_stats/), there's ton of them).","['I honestly don\'t know why people are complaining about this when there are other things in the update worth actually complaining about.

Hey Spotify community! Lets get spotify to pay their artists more!,"So being aware that Spotify pays their artists even as low as half of a cent per stream (which is disgustingly low) I decided to take action!

>Hello Spotify media employees!  
>  
>What I am going to ask may be a lot of you but its worth a shot. Would it be possible to get a message to the higher-ups? If I were to start a petition how many signatures would I need to have you guys pay your artists more? Currently at most your artists aren't even payed 1 cent per stream, and newer artists are getting not even a half of a cent (on average).  
>  
>The benefits of paying your artists more would include having more artists wanting to use Spotify as a platform to share their music and therefore drawing in more customers. Artists would be more happy to suggest Spotify to aspiring artists or where their fans should/could find them. Artists would be more likely to have Spotify exclusives increasing Spotify's value thereof!  
>  
>Thank you for hearing me out and thank you for your time, I would appreciate some thought and and I and the community will do everything we can to make this happen!

Does anyone else hate the difference in volume between the music and the commercials?,"I play spotify pretty much only at work.  I put on ambient digital music that's not very loud but not super quiet either.

For a while I thought about upgrading my account just so I could get rid of them, but thats like negotiating with terrorists. So instead I've made it into a game to see how quickly I can mute the commercials and get back to my work before unmuteing it again a minute or two later.  It seems like Spotify likes to play this game too because they like to unmute it sometimes so they can blast commercials at me anyway.  

The sad part is that I would gladly listen or watch their commercials if they didn't try to blow out my ear drums in the process.  I work in advertising and I like keeping up with new campaigns and see what some of the national brands are up to.  

If you work at Spotify can you please try to fix this?  I like the service and would consider upgrading in the future, but right now I just don't like you enough to give you my money.

It's been about a year since I [reached your 10,000 song limit](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/257a98/10000_song_limit_on_your_music/). After I reached it, I [completely reinvented the way I organize music](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/2nbzkj/how_i_use_spotify/) so that I could continue enjoying my time with you. But then you rolled out an update that [broke all that](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/2z5qpe/new_update_1011060gc75ebdfd_mega_discussion/cph9yye) and I was forced to start using a new provider. 



I love that Google Play doesn't create any limitations on the amount of music I can enjoy, but it's still not as good as you, Spotify. If you told me tomorrow that I could have as many songs as I want in my library, I would cancel my Google subscription and come back with my tail between my legs. 

I promise...","['I have been commenting on the community thread for an year now and there is still no news of if or when this will be fixed.

What's keeping me from subscribing to this r/spotify,"I'm a huge fan of Spotify, I don't love absolutely everything about it but it's pretty amazing for what it is. The way it integrates with all my devices has caused me to be on it all the time discovering new music and making sweet playlists. I was very happy to notice there is a subreddit for spotify last night and after browsing of the page I'm disappointed to see that this subreddit is just full of people complaining (about the app specifically). 

Today Spotify changed the theme green to a different shade and people are vocalizing their rage here and it's pathetic. Why the hell do we have to be so offended by that? Complaining about changes to an app on a daily basis is pretty f***ing stupid. There are plenty of other things to talk about on r/spotify but I don't think I'll be subscribing unless this becomes a little less like plenty of the other subreddits out there that are full of empty complaints about trivial things. Companies/app devs are constantly changing and adapting their apps and if you can't handle change to a program because of your primal instincts then maybe it's time to try something new. 

Just wanted to stick up for spotify a bit as well as all of the other great programs and services out there that have grabbed our attention.","[""There's always a ton of drive-by complainers and that is really annoying.

This is how I know a playlist is going to suck:,"How do I know when a playlist is a lazy mess, and not worth listening to?

When I see these 3 words:

**""Play on shuffle""**

That's a dead giveaway that the playlist creator dragged *entire albums* into the playlist. And that's a sure sign that the list creator is lazy and isn't making the best list they can. 

This is not to say there aren't perfect albums out there: There are. But when you're trying to create a consistent mood, it's very rare that a bunch of entire albums will fit the bill.

The best playlists are clearly the result of individually added tracks. Not albums.

More often than not when I listen to someone's playlist that's supposed to be listened to ""on shuffle"", it's got tons of whole albums -- and tons of tracks that don't fit.

I'll decide whether to shuffle or not. If you're going to make a playlist, build it the right way -- the slow way -- one track at a time.

The new UI is a total disaster,"I'm pretty sure it's not just me - the new UI just seems to be a complete mess.
    
My personal grievances are about the ridiculously large fonts and wasted space, and the black & white UI. While the previous UI was clearly Mac influenced (gradients, chrome look) it wasn't bad. In fact I considered it a pretty much usable UI and there wasn't anything really fundamentally wrong with it. It was usable and looked good.
    
However the new UI... my god. The first and the most obvious thing that caught my eye was the size of the text. Everything was big. Space was wasted with big margins. A playlist that used to fit to my screen now needed about twice the space and I needed to scroll. A neat, simple look was turned into a nightmare. It's like they're trying to force it into the Windows 8 look - which, by the way, is terrible. I'm not using a touch screen on my desktop and I sure as hell do not want to be forced into using a user interface designed for one. We're going backwards in usability here, I'm puzzled how the Spotify QA could let this get into production - then again I know nothing about their methods, so go figure.

Confused by this subreddit,"Hey all - 

I've been a spotify users for a few years, and I would estimate that I use it at least 2-3 hours every day.  I was hoping to find a Spotify subreddit inside of which Spotify users would share tips and tricks, or stories about how they use Spotify based on their own listening goals.

What I found instead is a sub that, as far as I can tell, has posts of two varieties.

1. Ridiculously overdramatic panicked posts about some feature change, followed by a rant about how Spotify did something that interrupted your VERY SPECIFIC way that you use Spotify, followed by a threat to LEAVE FOR APPLE MUSIC.  
2. Curated Playlists...which seem an odd choice for a Spotify subreddit.  Why not in a music subreddit?

As a child of the 80s that spent a FORTUNE on Tapes and CDs, I can assure you there has never been a greater musical value for less money than Spotify.  And yet the members of this sub lose their shit regularly when Spotify dares to move your cheese...never mind the fact that they may be making choices that serve a longer strategy that you are unaware of.  It's like $10 (and less for students) for essentially almost all of the music you'll ever need.

Shout out to Spotify about modded apks and why they should let us pick the song to play,"Yes, I've used a modded apk to play. But it made me love spotify as a platform, it made me install it on my pc and play countless songs, and this made spotify income, for sure.
I would have used the official app, but one thing was missing.

Here are my reasons about why spotify should make song picking not a premium feature:

- People loves finding new song, why stop them? More songs listened = more ads = more revenue

- On other platforms you can pick your songs, why not on mobile?

- More people would use the app, people like me that doesn't mind ads, kinda like a radio, but wishes to pick what to listen to. Leave premium for downloads, high quality, and other stuff, but let us pick, we will pay back with an incredible ad reach

Please think about making this change.

I hope someone from spotify will read this.
What do you guys think about this? I hope it makes sense, in my opinion it would benefit both spotify as a company and users","['> On other platforms you can pick your songs, why not on mobile?\n\nIt\'s the same reason Google makes you pay to have Youtube videos playing audio while the phone\'s screen is locked.  There\'s no technical reason to prohibit it but it\'s a feature that people want on mobile and will pay to get.\n\n> we will pay back with an incredible ad reach\n\nFrankly, that\'s not relevant to Spotify.  They use their ad-driven-free tier as one big ad for upsells to their paid service.  There are about 145 million Spotify customers in total.  Of those, [70 million are paid](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users) subscribers.\n\nSounds pretty good, right?  A 50/50 mix of paid versus free tier users.  But, from Spotify\'s perspective, it sucks.  Spotify made about 295 million Euro in 2017 on advertisements.  It [made 2.64 **billion** Euro on paid](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7833686/spotify-2016-losses-financial-results-revenue) subscriptions in that same time period.\n\nThe only reason Spotify continues to have a free tier is because recording labels let Spotify pay labels and artists less money for songs streamed by ad-supported users than by paying users.  That was a major argument in Spotify\'s last round of negotiations before trying to go public and is why big labels can now hold back new releases from free-tier users.\n\nSpotify doesn\'t want more ad impression spaces; it wants more credit card numbers.  Therefore, the answer to ""why can\'t I choose songs on mobile"" will always be ""because you\'ve not given a credit card number.""', 'Yes, they made SOME revenue, but the revenue generated from ads is a pittance compared to premium subscribers. I don’t know why people feel like it’s ok to use the modded apps or feel like they’re entitled to listen to whatever they want just because the paid platform has that ability. \n\nI think Spotify restricting features on the free platform is good as it allows people to get their foot in the door and see if they like it, the free tier shouldn’t be treated as “the same as premium but with ads” because it’s just not even close from a business perspective. It should be treated more like a trial experience without an expiration. \n\nBecause of this disparity in income, Spotify’s goal isn’t to increase streams and thus ads, but to encourage users to pay for their service which is why features are missing on mobile. But the mobile app didn’t even used to work AT ALL unless you had premium in the past - Mobile WAS the premium feature. A lot of people forget this.\n\nJust pay for your music people! Spotify isn’t a crazy high expense, and if you have a smartphone and data plan to support it chances are you can afford another $10/mo for what is IMO a great music service.']",2,586.0647069466086,spotify

FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO SYNC/DOWNLOAD LOCAL FILES FROM MY MACBOOK PRO TO MY IPHONE 6S SO THEY ARE AVAILABLE OFFLINE,"I've seen many threads that contain bits and pieces of the solution, but here is what I did. Ignore the whole uninstall/reinstall/firewall bullshit. At least I've been through all that to no avail. Here's how I got this solved:
 

**ON YOUR MACBOOK:**
So you have your local files that appear on Spotify. Make a new playlist and call it ""Local Files"". Drag all the songs (or whichever songs you want synced to your iPhone) from the original Local Files on the Spotify sidebar, to your new Local Files playlist.


**ON YOUR iPHONE**
You will see the new ""Local Files"" playlist appear. You click download, but the songs are not syncing when you try to download the playlist. The playlist is either ""waiting to download"" or ""waiting for wifi"" and most of the songs are greyed out (minus the tracks that Spotify found in its own database--those may be downloaded.) However, keep the playlist switched to Download.


**HERE'S THE FIRST STEP THAT MOST ""SOLUTIONS"" ARE MISSING:** On your iPhone Spotify app, click ""Your Library"" in the bottom right corner. Now on the top right, click the Settings icon. From there, click on ""Streaming Quality"". Scroll to the bottom and you will see **""DOWNLOAD USING CELLULAR""**, meaning you will be able to download songs over 3G/4G/LTE. **MAKE SURE THAT IS TURNED ON**. After it is turned on, go back to Your Library, and exit the app.


Create a personal hotspot from your iPhone. Settings -> Personal Hotspot. Turn that on, and join that hotspot on your computer under the WiFi icon on the top bar. Keep Spotify open on your desktop. Open Spotify back up on your iPhone.


Go to playlists on your iPhone. If you haven't yet, download your new Local Files playlist. 


**This, at least in my situation, magically cured this issue. All of the files now started downloading on my iPhone.**


After success, be sure to turn off the ""download using cellular"" unless you don't mind Spotify downloading music when you're not on wifi. 


Let me know if this worked for you! ","['What a hero. It worked for me too! Thank you so much! ', ""Dude, you're the fucking man! Thank you so much!\n""]",2,1038.849463891147,spotify

Foursquare/Swarm brings back a feature (mayorships) they had removed from their app. Is there any chance Spotify will bring back the Starred feature?,"Saw an interesting article on [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/22/8825205/swarm-app-mayorships-now-available).

I try to listen to lots and lots of music, and back when the feature was included in Spotify I'd 'star' maybe 2 or 3 songs from each album which a) helped me make a killer playlist and b) help me seek out (visually) my favorite tracks of artists/albums I don't really know that well.

Do you think there is any chance that Spotify will bring back the starred feature in the future? A man can dream...

"Offline device download limit of 3 devices for ""Family Plan"" ridiculous in 2017!","***Resolved - See update below

Longtime Spotify user but really frustrated.  I have a Family Plan for our 4 person family and my teenage kids are now old enough to enjoy listening to Spotify on the go.  Problem is, even with the Spotify ""Family Plan"" only 3 total devices can listen offline, like on an airplane or a long car ride where we live where there is often spotty cellphone coverage.  

So, one of us gets no offline device opportunity and the other 3 of us get to use it on just a single device (Shoot, I have 3 devices by myself - my phone, iPad and laptop!).  

Just looked it up and Apple Music allows up to 10 devices per person on their Family Music Plan.  Hard to believe Spotify has a 3 device maximum in 2017, seems more like 2007 all over again - looks like I'm not long for Spotify's music service which is a shame because I've really liked it all these years. ","[""Wait, shouldn't each account be a separate one without any global rules? AFAIK the only thing that family sharing changes is that you have one person paying for 6 full accounts without any limitations besides the household restriction. So each account should be able to use offline. Surprising that you have a different experience, maybe someone else with family can confirm this. "", ""Each user on the family plan gets their own 3 device limit. I've had the family plan since it came out and all my other family members have their 3 devices"", 'Ok...update here.  Thanks to all of the encouragement here, I logged into my control panel and there was some mixing of logins.  Cleaned that out and, yes, each family member can have 3 devices with offline downloads.  So, I humbly thank the community here.\n\nThat said, still not overly thrilled about the 3 device limitation per user when Apple Music offers 10 devices per user and also not thrilled about the 3,333 total Spotify downloads per device when Apple offers 100,000.  Still seems to me that Spotify is way behind the times on this, but thanks to everyone for the guidance on resolving the immediate crisis at hand! ;)']",9,806.5268134284515,spotify

Dear Spotify: here's why I'm leaving,"Not sure if I'm in the right subreddit for this, but I've got some gripes that I want to mention publicly in addition to direct feedback.

I've used Spotify for about 2-3 years, and I joined because I noticed that Pandora, my previous music source, lacked a lot of less popular artists. Spotify has been pretty good in terms of music availability. I also love the ""Discover Weekly"" and ""New Release Radar"" playlists, where I find a lot of my new music.

I guess the first complaint I'll mention is the one that pushed me over the edge to switch to Google Play Music. My library got full. I wanted to save an album, and got [this](https://i.imgur.com/BNJAvOb.jpg) message. I'm sorry, Spotify, but I'm paying you for a cloud service, and it doesn't really make sense to limit my library size... how much more infrastructure does it take to store a bigger master playlist?

The app is sometimes infuriatingly slow. From a cold start, sometimes it will take over 30 seconds to get music playing. Searches are the same way. This laggy behavior can happen on good or bad internet connections. It's not every time I search or start the app, but it is consistent enough that I've gotten used to it as an expected inconvenience. I've experienced this on all my phones, from a Galaxy s3 to a OnePlus 3t.

The Chromecast (1st gen) support is laughable, and obviously an afterthought. First off, the Chromecast app is in PORTRAIT orientation, letterboxed into the TV. It looks kind of like a port from the android app. Second, the play/pause icon on the TV shows the opposite state of the one in the app (if the music is paused, the TV shows the pause button, while the phone shows the play button). The whole thing is very laggy, and sometimes doesn't even load successfully (as in, no, you cannot play Spotify music on the Chromecast today)

Dear Spotify, we are paying for a music service which should be simple: lots of music, interesting playlists, offline listening, and easy to access on multiple platforms. You meet the first 3 fine, but it seems like you don't even have a team to test Android usability. If you put a dev/test team on the android app, you would quickly find the shortcomings of its usability.

I can't be the only one who thinks this.","['Used Google Play Music for a week.. worst week of my life.', ""Google Play Music isn't any better."", ""I understand about the poor development, the cache craziness and the laggy stuff - I don't really get why there are so many complaining about the library limit.

Can you sort them into genres, moods or any category you imagine? Then do playlists, the Spotify system around that is better than any other company. And also, any service you pay has limits.\n\nI absolutely support what you say about usability, all the slow response in a medium computer/android (it's nonsense) and why they didn't focus in addressing all this before.

[Question] Is there a comprehensive list of Albums that aren't on Spotify?,"As the title suggests, I'd like to fill some of the holes within the spotify library by acquiring the albums that aren't available on spotify. However, I cannot find a list of albums that do not appear on Spotify. For example, Dr Dre's first album - The Chronic isn't available, even though his other album is. Going through every artist and comparing spotify's available albums against their wikipedia page is possible, I'm just wondering if someone has already done this.","[""There's literally dozens of other posts that has been made about this exact same question.\n\nNo, there is no master list of which artists/albums are available. The primary reason is that this is always changing. An artist or album may be available one day, but it could be taken down the following week per request of the rights holders.\n\nThe second reason being that Spotify's library is 20million+ now. It's too cumbersome to keep a list of albums that aren't available as it would be ridiculously large."", ""Maybe we should contact the mods to get a Google Docs spreadsheet or something of the sort going.

Is this how Spotify works? Seems unfair,"So I have been using a modded apk version of Spotify for quite some time because I couldn't afford to pay the subscription. Because now I can afford it and they started threating user accounts that use modded versions I thought of becoming a premium user. 

I have been searching how Spotify monetization works for artists because I thought it worked like Youtube's. I read that no matter what music you listen to 70% of the revenue from ads and subscription is paid to artists. The amount depends of the  artist's songs and how popular those songs are.

I want to pay for a Spotify premium account but...,"I won't. 

I'm sharing this with you guys because I want to see if some Spotify employee can ""hear"" me here. 

This is my complain:

I've got my month's trial premium a year ago (or even more) and I paid for next months too, then as I had an iPod in that days (no data plan, so no fun) I've unsubscribed of the service, but there was a problem where Spotify charged me another month, I got mad and used PayPal's features to ask a refund, which was granted. 

Till now all seems good right? But isn't cause I've never expected that Spotify would banned me for that reason... Never crossed my mind to stop using Spotify's services... Just wanted a little time until I got a gadget to properly enjoy the streaming outside BUT THEY JUST BANNED ME! My playlist are there and I don't have access to them, indeed I thought I couldn't use the service anymore with that email (my personal email), I figured out a workaround, I could log in using my Facebook's account but I dislike using Facebook as a tool to log in into my accounts... Being I the client of that service and showing my unconformity I went to Spotify help menu and asked for a ticket and explained my complain but today there are no responses about it and I don't see a reason why should I being forced using my Facebook account or another email to enjoy the service and cannot log in anymore using my email just because I've asked a refund with PayPal... 

I like the service and nowadays I have no complains to get a couple months, but I prefer to use my old account (email one) and in order to don't lose my new playlist in the Facebook one a workaround to keep both alive because if they are able to give me back my old account I wouldn't like that tracks fade away... Again. 

TL;DR: In the past I had a couple problems with the service so I asked a refund with PayPal, then Spotify denied me to log in with that account, as a workaround I can log in using my Facebook account (or another email) but I dislike that options, I've showed my complains with the company but never care about it, I keep using the service and I like it more than before, but in order to get a premium account i would like to keep both accounts (because of the playlists).

How to get more female artists in Spotify-suggested playlists?,"I was listening to my Liked Songs the other day (which is primarily songs from my Discover Weekly) and noticed that a lot of the songs were by male artists. Upon realizing this I made it a point for the next two weeks to intentionally seek out and listen to female artists. I thought maybe I could tip the algorithm in favor of suggesting more female artists. No such luck. My Discover Playlist this week included ONE female artist. There were FOUR bands that included at least one female member. The other 25 songs were by male artists or all male bands. Today I logged on and Spotify had a list of suggested albums for me. Of these there were ZERO female artists, ONE band that included a female member, and the other NINE albums were by males artists or all male bands. In the radio playlist for a female singer/songwriter, only 43% were by female artists. 
 
I know this sexism has been written about previously, not just for individual suggestions but in global top lists as well: https://thebaffler.com/latest/discover-weakly-pelly

I guess my questions are:
1) Why is there not an equalizer algorithm embedded in Spotify? This would provide equal representation of male/female artists to all listeners, not just the ones who noticed their Spotify is sexist and downloaded a separate app. 
2) Is there any way to tip your personal algorithms in favor of recommending more female artists?

What Spotify DESPERATELY NEEDS... instant cross-fade,"For those who like to switch songs every 30 seconds.. let us feel like the DJ’s we ARE. 
",0,0,197.8476351882407,spotify
I made the switch to Spotify a few months ago and now I'm thinking about switching back.,"I had been using Apple Music ever since it came out to listen to music because it was already on my phone and it seemed to do the trick. A few months ago, some of my friends convinced me to make the switch saying that it was better to share playlists and find new music, both of which I was very intrigued by, so I decided to make the switch. At first it seemed great, sharing playlists, finding new music, being able to fade into new songs (love this feature), etc. But then things changed.

&#x200B;

The more I used the app the more problems I discovered and I started to becoming more and more frustrated. What problems am I talking about? Well here are just a few that I personally have noticed:

* **There are no full lyrics of songs.** Yes I know everyone says this and it's ""pending,"" but like honestly, who cares about ""Behind the Lyrics""? I, and so many other people, so much rather have the lyrics right there in front of them, and NOT only displaying as they are sung, but a tab where you can view them.
* **You can't see all of an artist's songs.** What I mean by this is when you click on an artist, there is no ""show all songs"" button to see all of there songs. Preferably there would be with a filter that you can sort them by release date, popularity, most plays, or something. Yes, I know you can search the artist's name up and then click ""See all songs"" but that is not all songs of the artist but all songs from your specific search, two very different things.
* **The recent searches feature just flat-out sucks.** So you would think that any of your past searches would pop up, but no...only if you select the search. Like I want to see my recent SEARCHES, but just recent selections. On top of that, if one of my recently searched songs is on the list I CAN'T FREAKING PLAY IT JUST BY CLICKING ON IT. This is beyond frustrating. Instead, it brings me to a page about the album it's in and other useless info.

&#x200B;

These are just a few of my frustrations with Spotify that are making me want to make the switch back to Apple Music, especially seeing that Apple just added the search by lyrics option and Spotify can't even display the song ""Don't Lose Control"" when I search ""Dont Lose Control."" Like honestly.

&#x200B;

What I'm really wondering here is why do you stand by Spotify and continue to use it. I'm not saying you are dumb for using Spotify in any sense, I just genuinely want to know.

&#x200B;

Why is the free version of Spotify android such garbage ?,"I have no problems with the pc version and have been using it for more than a year now. I recently installed the mobile version and it's absolute dogshit.

Reasons:

- The next song in the playlist / album rarely plays by itself. Most of the time i have to unlock my phone and pause and unpause the song so the next one plays,

- You get only 6 skips per hour. Like what the hell ? Why is the free version of spotify on mobile such a downgrade from the pc version ?

- You can only listen to Albums, Non spotify playlists and your own playlists on shuffle. With the 6 skips per hour and the suffle mode it's so annoying when you listen to music and can't skip a song you don't like,

- They throw random songs in your playlist. When you finish a cycle of your playlist they start playing some random songs that are not even in my playlist. The reason i have a fucking playlist is so i can listen to a select few songs i really like. Not for spotify to show some hot garbage up my throat,

- The same is with artists albums. I recently found an artist i really like and wanted to listen to a specific album, but no. When i played it, the first song wasn't even from that album, and it's on shuffle so you can't even listen to the whole album. Why the hell do they mix some random songs from that artist in an album. 

What the hell is wrong with this app ?

Spotify shuffle - is it 100% random?,"Maybe I'm going mad, but it seems shuffle on Spotify is not all that random. 

It seems i tend to get some of the more recent songs I've added played one after the other. In some occasions, shuffle will always play the same two songs back to back on different occasions. I've had my account nearly 8 years now so there are plenty of songs to shuffle from in my songs. It just seems really predictable and i quite often find songs that haven't been played in a long time. 

Has anyone else experienced this before? I don't really have a proper way of proving this without some crazy statistical / probability test, so I'm just going to cast the net and see what i catch. 

Thanks! ","[""No, spotify's shuffle is really awful, it's one of two things I hate about spotify (the other being the 3333 song download limit).

"""I'm With the Banned""-Music Streaming and Identity Politics","Notorious BIG, Flatbush Zombies, Antix, B.O.B, the Flobots, all have/had messages considered politically incorrect at some point in their careers, and their overall musical personas were often overshadowed by their more commercial hits. My point is, the thoughts and values behind lyrics are as important as the fresh beats they're lain upon. That said, what place is it for streaming services to promote some perspectives over others?

I'm not here to debate politics, in fact, I'm here to argue that music streaming services (not musicians) shouldn't involve themselves in identity politics, and I'm happy to unsubscribe. How does this have to do with music? Like Google, Spotify now filters music with politically incorrect messages and titles, and music is about free expression and dialogue, something lost by race-baiting rappers into cashing in on a trend rather than genuinely discussing political philosophy. In all of Spotify, there is only one artist with a secular humanist, anti-liberal message, and he's the only reason I bought premium to begin with.

I will send out a reminder email five days before payment due date, if payment is not received by 24 hours before the billing day I will have to remove you from the plan.

Requirements:
USA accounts only. 
PayPal only. 
You cannot be presently enrolled in Spotify Premium, you must be on the free service. If you are premium you will need to create a new account. 
Before I add you to the group plan you will need to change your account's zip code to mine, to satisfy Spotify's requirement of ""same household"".

Leaving the plan is simple, just let me know as far in advance as you can and at the end of the billing cycle I will remove your account.

Spotify shuffle and queue broken for MONTHS — driving me insane!!,"I've read the blog post about Spotify's recent changes to shuffle, however in practice...it doesn't shuffle shit! I have 386 songs (>26 hours) on my starred playlist, yet in a normal 10 hour work day, the same songs get repeated multiple times? This isn't just on occasion, it's every single day!

Secondly, the last song you queue gets repeated. It happens every time for me on both the OS X and iOS client. If you queue a single song...it always plays twice!

I'm not going to say these bugs are ruining my life, but as somebody with ADHD, I'm getting distracted far too often having to babysit Spotify. I notice every damn time when the same song starts playing from the beginning.. :(

Please fix your shit, Spotify. I'm a developer myself so I appreciate things aren't always as simple as they seem, but christ, the queue repeating issue cannot be hard to debug...and it's been months!

LPT (Life Pro Tip) - You can play spotify off of two devices if one (mobile) is in Airplane Mode and has items downloaded to it.,"Title says it all.  I just came across (realized) this earlier today.  I'm at my computer w/ Spotify playing online.  My phone (HTC ONE) is in airplane mode playing a playlist that I have downloaded to the device.  It seems as if the mobile device takes precedence, once a new track is played, either through the current track ending or selecting another track the playback on my PC stops with the normal message about multiple devices.

Although, it seems that you can keep on switching tracks on a PC and the playback won't be interrupted on the mobile device until it switches to the next track.

I know this may be ""alerting"" the Spotify Devs of this tip that frequent this subreddit, but I don't really see a way for them to do away with it other than eliminating the possibility of offline playback (or shooting down that idea entirely) unless there is an active internet connection which would be BS.  That really kills the whole idea of being able to make songs available offline....","['This is both kinda obvious and not really a problem. Basically all you\'re doing is removing yourself from Spotify\'s network and using it in offline mode.

MAKE SPOTIFY GREAT AGAIN!,"With the most recent update, spotify has completely ruined the beautiful, organized, and simplistic layout of the library tab.

Its was essentially just your entire library, organized by artist. With the update, this no longer exists. The only artists who appear are ones you follow. There is no more liking a song, then later finding that artist in the artist tab. This has made creating playlist far more difficult.

WHAT THE FUCK! MY SPOTIFY ACCUONT WAS LEAKED,"Today morning I woke up to an email saying my email address was successfully changed, and I no longer have access to spotify. 

Why the fuck is this even an option in spotify??!?!?

I reverse searched my email and it pulled up with some french fucking site of over 400+ leaked accounts and their passwords on some fucking forum. 

I'm furious beyond measure right now. ~~How the fuck did spotify information get leaked? What kind of fucking potato servers do they have???~~

___

**Edit:** I'd like to clear some up some stuff as I was pretty pissed when I posted this. My password was unique to spotify. I personally thought it was pretty secure since it was in two different languages and had special characters. However, it was a short password. 

Account is using my email which I only use for subscripton services and personal emailing. It shouldn't have been exposed to anything shady. 

I was hacked by a french hacking group, which even on their website they have a guide you can purchase which shows a detailed way of how you can specifically hack spotify accounts and netflix accounts through brute force without password guessing. The website also encourages its users not to change password or emails to prevent users like me from changing passwords/emails. 

What really was surprising to me was how inefficient Spotify's account security system was. Sure, even if a hacker hacks me, I should have the free will to access my own account through my email, change the password, and make it more secure. This was not the case. 

Spotify lets you change your email and completely disregard the email you had used previously. **COMPLETELY.** The hacker changed my email and thats it: My account was gone. I could no longer access my account in any way possible because I did not have the email to my account nor password. I could not request a forgotten password because it wouldn't go to my email anymore. 

The only reason I found out was because I received an email saying that my email for spotify changed. That's it. Now imagine if this email went into my spam list? How would I have thought of recovering my account? What if I had no more proof of my subscription purchase? 

There's no two-factor authentication and it's really fucking easy to lose your account if someone knows your credentials. 

To all of those assholes commenting saying I shouldn't be using the same passwords everywhere in a very aggressive way, I don't; don't make assumptions for internet brownie points. 

Spotify gave me back the account, but didn't sound sincere in doing so. It's just business. They lost my respect and my business. I'm done with them.

What an absolutely terrible business decision. This needs to be said.,"Removed my original rant because, while I still generally disagree with what happened, I no longer believe it was anything intentional.

Basically my long time premium account, always paid for directly through Spotify @ the 9.99 price, had a auto-payment fail due to me getting a new debit card.

In this period between failed payment and updating of my payment method, Spotify cancelled my subscription. When I reactivated it, since I did it through the iOS App, my account was converted to a 12.99 subscription handled by Apple.


This caused confusion because I have had failed auto-payments before and updated my payment method in iOS app, yet maintained my 9.99 sub. The difference this time was that they deactivated my account.


I previously thought Apple took over the failed payment notifications for existing Spotify users in an attempt to get them to convert them into a higher price point @ 12.99, but I was wrong.

I do still feel that after being a paying member for years, a failed payment should just put my account on hold until I get around to putting in my updated number, then obviously should be returned to my previous subscription price. I understand that this may be an honest mistake and I'm sure Spotify will convert me back to the old subscription after cancelling my iOS sub.

Wanted to clear this up as to not slander a company unwarrantably. ","[""I'm not sure if you fully understand the issue. The price increase is because Apple has a 30% share of all in-app purchases. If Spotify charges the same amount for a premium subscription on iOS as they do on their website, they'd be losing $3 per subscription. That's a lot of money, so I don't blame them for increasing the price. Especially since Apple has launched Apple Music. That means that they are now competing with Spotify, but also getting a kickback from in-app subscribers. Should Spotify take a financial hit to help a new competitor? Doesn't make sense to me. \n\nI mean, I get the frustration, but I thought emails were sent out regarding this, and it was also reported on.

Spotify shuffle (for android at least) is TERRIBLE,"I honestly can't describe how bad it is.

Now, I absolutely love Spotify, and it's by far my favourite music service, but my god the shuffle.

I have a lot of Paramore songs in my library, and a bunch of other songs by misc artists. Say I choose a song by Paramore and then press shuffle, the upcoming song list is FULL of Paramore songs. If I choose a non-paramore song and press shuffle, Paramore don't show up for ages.

Another thing. Let's say I didn't like my initial Paramore shuffle, I'll turn shuffle off and on again, right? Wrong. Upon doing that and looking at the queue, it's exactly the same Paramore songs just in a different order, and this is reliable and repeatable. 

How hard is it really for them to do a shuffle that is genuinely just your songs in a random order.

"My theory about Apple, Spotify, and battery life.","So I’ve been having some major issues with battery life, have been ever since I moved over to Spotify about a year ago (as a result of Apple’s lunatic decision to make Apple Music look very bad in my opinion, but I digress).

Anyway, the problem began on iOS 10. Spotify would use around 40-50% of my battery life. We’re talking my phone would go from 100% to 0% when using Spotify for 3 hours. Absolutely infuriating. And almost pushed me to drop Spotify.

However I realized some things. The cause is Spotify go/active or whatever they call it where you can control which device music is played on. It’s annoying you can’t turn off this feature but whatever, I kept digging. Eventually I learned that if I turn off wifi it would fix the issue (presumably because Spotify active is turned off). So I was able to survive, wasting a lot of data, but I have an unlimited plan so it was doable. (Note that being in offline mode does nothing to mitigate the problem)

But then one day I did something, I turned off statistics for Apple (in the privacy setting) and boom, the problem was solved.

However, with the recent “upgrade” to iOS 11 Spotify has once again begun shitting itself in terms of my battery performance. With the stats turned off.

So I have a couple theories. The most prevalent of which, and believable being that Apple is collecting data without consent in a similar fashion to the statistics. By doing this it messes with the Spotify code and as a result causes my battery life to drain like crazy.

The second theory is that Apple is actively sabotaging Spotify by ruining their battery life. Why this has not been addressed by Spotify  (as others are having the same problem) is beyond me.

Regardless, idgaf about any of the company sabotage or even being spied on, even though I’d obviously prefer it not be the case, I just want spotify to work properly. So please can someone do something about this?

Also, I realize there are many other potential factors for the cause of this but given that turning off stats fixed it in the past makes me sceptical it’s not a malignant issue. Although, it may be some form of encryption or something?

Comparing Spotify With Apple Music,"Fuck this update.
Switched to apple a couple weeks ago and theres a lot of things I like better about this app.

In order of most important to least, with apple you can:

- Save individual songs / delete bonus tracks or remixes tacked onto the ends of albums that i don't want to save

- Scroll through my library using an alphabetical scroll bar

- Have access to music i didnt with spotify. Now i can listen to Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and a number of other albums that aren't on spotify

- None of the new bullshit with ""liking"" songs, you can still like songs but its not stupid like how spotify does it.

- Load pages without a 3-10 second loading delay when internet connection is spotty, and my albums dont start randomly fucking disappearing from my library when im not connected well to the internet

- View lyrics to most songs right in the app with the tap of a button

- Select a song to ""play later""(add to queue) but now I can also say ""play next"". Plus to get to the queue you just scroll down instead of tapping something and you can swipe to delete songs from the queue

The bad parts of apple music:

- No dark theme

- Probably not as good as apple at radio type stuff but I never used that anyway so im not the best to ask

Overall apple music is just way faster and more user friendly now than spotify is.

EDIT

The decision really comes down to how you use the app. If you are more interested in receiving music recommendations and listening in a radio/playlist style then spotify is the way to go. If you are interested in a big organized music library of albums then you may want to consider switching to Apple.

"I broke Spotify on accident, and I hope it never fixes.","
(Spotify didn't break, my aux cord didn't work)

For some reason, I turned on Spotify and now every song is being played weird. Realllllly weird. In fact, what I've narrowed it down to is only recorded instruments and vocals are being played by ALL songs. No mastering or bloops or bleeps

It's so satisfying, and I can even hear things not normally present in the songs like breathing. Can this be feature, please?

It sounds like I'm in the recording studio, and the vocals are muffled only by the glass.

***edit*** 

I was chilling playing games as I made these notes. On further inspection, the greatest impact is definitely the vocals. In general, they are far more laid back, and their volume takes a definite back row to the instrumentals. Still testing some songs and will report a few samples later.

***solution*** 

As some users stated, the issue was in fact the Aux cord. Apparently the one I used must be plugged in half way to play music correctly. Toying with it I found that slightly loose lowered vocals while slightly too far lowered instrumentals. Either way, I like this new nifty trick. I still enjoy it very much. If samples are still requested just Pm me.

Quick question. (No need to upvote),"So I just signed up for Spotify family so my dad and I can listen at the same time.

I made a playlist on the other account with about 900 songs and I'm following it with the new account but now I can't add songs to it without switching back to the other account. 

So my question is is there a way to transfer all those songs from my old account to this one to where I can still add songs to the playlist? Like can I create a copy of that playlist without have to transfer the songs one by one? Thanks in advance.

Spotify requires facebook authentication to cancel account. Raging!,"Hello,

So the other day my girlfriend and I went out and spent all of our money on a new (used) car. I wanted to put my spotify subscription on hold for a couple of weeks as money is tight. When I got to the cancellation page it wanted me to authorize with facebook in order to cancel.

I said no, fuck that, facebook doesn't get to decide when I cancel my services. I sent them a strongly worded email telling them to cancel my subscription and I don't want to authorize facebook to cancel my subscription. 

They sent me back an email saying literally ""don't worry about it."" Then they didn't cancel my account and charged me again the next day. I tried going into my bank today to take care of it and they said since it isn't a fraudulent charge they couldn't reverse the charge but I could get a new debit card number if I can't cancel. They suggested I tried calling the number they had on the charge first.

When I called the number there was an automated response telling me to go online or send in a customer support request (both of which I already did). Defeated and not wanting to cancel my debit card over this I authorized facebook to let me cancel my spotify account. 

I loved spotify, but to me this is unacceptable. I shouldn't have to tell facebook anything to cancel any service except facebook. I sent in a reply demanding a refund but I doubt anything will ever come of it. It'll be the last $10 they ever get from me. ","[""Every time I have contacted Spotify via email.

Is shuffle 100% Random?,"I have a playlist wich start with song with about 150/160 bpm and it end with song with 190-220 bpm. I noticed when i turned shuffle on and start with a slower bpm song it plays more of that bpm first and when it plays 1 faster song it looks like it plays more. Songs with higher bpms. Is there some kind of algorythm that it stays more to songs that sound somular? Or has this something to do with the order i placed the songs in? Or is this just not true at al? 

Here is [playlist i am talking about](https://open.spotify.com/user/1170935734/playlist/7wC2SrLATPwzLzAK2eYfh2?si=O0-QWyTqQ0Oy2mrcMkl6Ow)

Spotify needs to take greater responsibility with its adverts,"Specifically, I am talk about an advert for clinical trials.

More than other adverts, this one caught my ear. For those who haven’t heard it, the advert is for a company offering positions on a clinical trial program. There is a stated incentive: £900 and paid travel with accommodation, and a couple of caveats such as being a non-smoker and being in a certain age bracket. There are also some sentiments about furthering medicine.

My issue with this is an ethical one. Clinical trials have the potential to be dangerous. I don’t have first, or second hand experience, which may mean my argument is misguided, or the motivation for it is misplaced, but having watched [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9_sX93RHOk) (which I would recommend) I would be very uncomfortable with recommending the practice to anyone. I accept this may be a poor or edge-case example, but it is what I am familiar with.

Alarm bells rung louder when I considered who will be listening to this advert. Those who get Spotify adverts are not premium members - they aren't paying for the service. From that a conclusion could be drawn that non-premium members are less better off financially than their premium counterparts. In not only offer the prospect of money, but actually enticing with what I would deem a lucrative figure, I imagine makes the offer extremely tempting for some people. Similarly, I imagine non-premium users on average would be younger than the premium users. This ties-in again with the monetary aspect, and  the programs specifications.
Finally, although this is pure speculation, I imagine there is a sophisticated algorithm for targeting the adverts at people who are most likely to respond. Generally, I think targeted adverts are great - it’s much better getting something that appeals than not - but in this case, I feel it malicious.

Furthermore, it seems so at odds with other adverts on Spotify. This may be the first time I’ve come across this one, but on plenty of occasions I’ve had ones concerning safety at sea, drink driving and sexual disease prevention. Whilst it could be argued that in the long run clinical trials are likewise for the betterment of health, I don’t see this advert as one and the same with the others mentioned.

I don’t take issue with the company whose name I cannot recall - honestly, I think it is well marketed - but Spotify. By nature people are impressionable and although presenting the advert is nothing close to an endorsement, it does suggest Spotify would have no qualms with their users partaking in clinical trials. Perhaps most worryingly, this advert likely got through several layers of the company.",0,0,156.34775093131873,spotify

I Am Not Liking This App...At All,"I'm asking to be flamed I know. I'm a loooooooooooooong time Google Play Music user for music discovery and I also use Rocket Player for my own physical files, and I wanted to try Spotify...I wanted it to replace Play Music which hasn't had an update in a long time...

I HATE it. I can't use it anymore. I can't describe the depths of my loathing for this app. I am so disappointed. SO MUCH LAG! ON MY HOME WIFI!!! The Albums menu will not load half the time, and I have to uninstall it and reinstall it to get it working again, which is obviously a HUGE inconvenience. I have high speed internet at home and a relatively good phone with Android 8. This happens so frequently, I'm getting really pissed.

&#x200B;

And how do you rate songs? It seems like you either HAVE the song in your library or you don't. I'm not a streamer person, I don't have the luxury of unlimited data, I need to download my music to my device, and I tried to download and it took forever to download one song. And why did the cute fav heart change to a 'save' or 'follow'  when I started the free trial? That is so not-cute. This user interface should be the same no matter if you are free or premium. I -liked- the hearts. Now its really small ugly text to add music. 

&#x200B;

This whole app is just bad, I don't know why its higher rated than others. I have yet to find an artist on spotify that I can't on Google Play, and Google has all the mature rated uncensored version of some of my favorite albums that Spotify does -not-. There's no easy way to tell either if an album is explicit language or not.  I don't need censorship.

&#x200B;

The only benefits I can see to using this app is the desktop app.  I am not happy with this, or else I'm using this app wrong. Or I haven 't found the big 'omg thats awesome' function of this yet. I know you are going to flame me, I'm fine, but if you can point me out how I'm doing things wrong, please tell me. Otherwise I'm not sure I can adapt to this. I want to give this a chance, but I'm thinking its a lost cause.",0,0,219.69800556107526,spotify

* Can anyone explain how the Radio tab works? I don't really understand it.

Long-time Pandora user finally trying Spotify and I don't see the appeal. Am I missing something?,"I've used Pandora (free account) for years. I like being able to pick an artist/song and have it play similar songs. I've been introduced to some pretty cool music that way.

My biggest gripe with Pandora has been not being able to play a specific song on demand (which I always heard you can do on Spotify). But also, how many live/remix versions of songs show up that I don't want to hear, and how repetitive the Pandora stations feel to me.

I've always eyed Spotify as an alternative, but never actually tried it until a few days ago... and I just don't get it. You can search for a song and then start Shuffle Play, which seems to be the equivalent of Pandora's stations. From what I can tell, both Pandora and Spotify's premium seem to also offer the same features (including on-demand playback) for the same price.

So, what's the reason to choose Spotify over Pandora? Or to choose Spotify Premium over Pandora Premium? Would love to hear others thoughts.","["">I've used Pandora (free account) for years.

What would make us choose an album over a playlist?

(...?)","['I listen to playlists all the time, almost more so than albums. They’re really useful for artist discovery within a certain type of sound, since I have a tendency to just listen to one album I like over and over and that quickly gets repetitive. Also fantastic for mood-setting and general background soundtracking, when I don’t necessarily care as much about the album or artist as I do about creating a certain atmosphere.', ""I almost never listen to albums. Just when I'm looking to see if I like said album. I listen to the playlist I made when I want to sing or lipsync along to the music. I listen to classical music playlists when I want to read. And I listen to sleep or relaxing playlists when I'm having trouble sleeping."", 'I almost exclusively listen to playlists. Especially long playlists with a lot of variety.', ""I'm always searching for new playlists that are similar to my own or even different as it gives me an idea for crafting a new one."", 'Well, I listen to albums that I like and enjoy, but I also listen to playlists that I have created.', ""I listen to playlists. Partly to find suitable music for my own playlists. Also to create a certain mood - I would choose CD or downloaded albums in the the same way so a playlist is like a (usually longer) well-crafted compilation album.  Some playlists I follow because they update regularly and I can find new music in that specific genre. I have no interest in multi-genre playlists. Spotify itself makes godawful mainstream playlists and I've been unimpressed by some of their slightly more niche playlists.  Still a little too bland.

10.000 songs limit,"Hey. I've been using Tidal for quite a long time, but then decided to change it to Spotify like year and a half ago because i find some of Tidal features annoying.

What happened to me today is just ridiculous. 10.000 songs limit? Seriously Spotify? I hadn't had idea about this bullshit, and now I'm really mad as fk. 

I've read some threads concerning this, and I realise that I can do for example playlists of some albums, or just leave 1 song of each album, but this is just fkin madness. I've been paying for this shit for months and never expected something as stupid to come up.

I understand, that 10.000 songs is really a lot and most people probably don't even come close to this limit, however I'm a complete musical freak, listening to probably like 3 or 4 new albums each day and love tons of music from most of music genres. I also frequently add albums to my library that i don't find so great, but one day I'll probably want to come back to them. 

So is there any way (like seriously any way) i can get rid of this stupid limit? 

I'm really, really mad Spotify, this is complete absurd. ","[""That's the most annoying thing about Spotify right now. I have to remove music from my library.

New app design is a worrying development for album listeners,"I'm sure many of you have seen the new [UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/84d18e/spotifys_new_ui/) which looks to be heading in a direction where albums are becoming redundant on Spotify. This combined with the fact that there is a limit of 10,00 saved songs makes life difficult for those of us who love albums and listening to lots of music. I've tried both Apple Music and Google Play Music but both are miles behind Spotify in app design for mobile and desktop. I've been using Spotify for about 4 years and it has been an incredible tool in putting virtually all recorded music at my finger tips. 

This movement away from the traditional album format has been happening for years now but I don't see why Spotify alienates hardcore music fans by having such a relatively small ceiling for saved songs and by making searching for full albums so awkward.

If anyone has any workarounds it would be much appreciated because at the moment I'm just putting unsaving thousands of songs in my playlists. ",0,0,574.1345333393635,spotify

Anyone else hate the new Coca Cola advert?,"It’s literally my worst nightmare. Worse than that ad where that stupid Texan woman spending 30 seconds talking about her stupid corgi puppy, if you remember that. But no. This is worse. The voice actor is dull and incredibly bland, the message of the advert is completely irrelevant to Coca Cola, and the sound effects are not only bad, but are so sharp and actually cause my ears pain. The final nail in this coffin though is the background music, which is ‘ooh nada niyay, don’t act like you know me’ song, which is without a doubt my least favourite song ever made. I mean most pop music now is just the same old shitty song, different day, but that one takes the cake. The woman’s voice is annoying, the chorus is annoying, lyrics are laughably bad, and the whole song is just so pointless.

Spotify needs a Play next feature,"I have recently tried the apple music service (The free 3 months trial) and even though I still prefer Spotify the simple feature to play next is SO useful.

Grrr! I've been having various issues with Spotify for over a month. I'm going to cancel my premium. Has anyone else been having problems too?,"The most recent issue is the search feature is not working.  Before that it would only give me the spinning green circle of death and not even let me access my downloaded music.  Before that it kept saying I was offline when I clearly was connected and everything other than Spotify was working fine.  Before that it was randomly deleting songs and whole playlists.  Before that when I was still using my iPod touch, it kept spontaneously closing and on my third time my iPods screen was in sleep mode and my iPod never turned back on - so Spotify may or may not been responsible for crashing my iPod and reducing me to a crappy kindle fire because my iPod was two weeks out of warranty. :/

Every time I have an issue I get the same response - Reboot.  It costs me more to redownload my music every time I reboot than I pay for Spotify in the first place!  When I explain this to them and tell them that I don't want to do so unless they have the issues worked out, I'm always rudely told to go somewhere and use free public WiFi.  I live in a really rural part of Cali and its at least 100 miles to free public WiFi!  Shit!  Why can't they just get their shit together?!?!  I love the concept, but they are having trouble putting it action.  When I pay hard earned money for a service I expect to get what I am paying for!!!  Sure I don't have to listen to commercials, but over half the time lately I can't even listen to my frickin music either!  I'm giving them until the 15th, and if I don't see any improvement I'm cancelling my premium subscription.  This is getting beyond ridiculous.  I already have Amazon Prime, I guess I'll have to start settling for Prime music. :/

What is Spotify doing in the past months?,"I use Spotify (Premium) every day since a year now, and I feel like more features are being removed than implemented.

Major features removed:
* Lyrics Button (wtf? why couldn't they wait until a new system was ready?)
* Notification Button (what was even the problem with that in the first place?)

Of course there have been some good implementations as well, for example Chromecast, but I feel like the amount of features and transparency is pretty small compared to the immense success I believe Spotify has.

I won't cancel my subscription because I think it is still very much worth it, but I still wonder.

What are your thoughts on that? ","['Lyrics were supplied by musicXmatch, they ditched spotify to create a standalone app and signed with Apple music.\n\nThe reason so many features are gone is because they are trying to make the client more like the webclient.', ""I would also like to know what's happening. The are constantly removing features. The notifications (for following artists) work as expected, it is just removed from the GUI in newer versions of the desktop client. I have older Linux clients where the notifications just continue to work.

Do you want a silly way to listen to music?,"Go on Spotify. Select an artist and try to be random about it. Look at all of his/her/band's songs and pick one track. The track is about a theme that you choose. It could be ""weird"", ""lonesome"", ""happy"", ""stupid"", ""cheerful"", ""heartbreak"", ""carpe diem"", or whatever. After you play the song, go to the page of one of his/her/band's ""related artists"". Do the same - listen to one track. Next, choose one of that person's (or band's) ""related artists"" and listen to another song. 

This is a good way to listen to obscure tracks that were not presented on radio. As for myself, I found a wild John Denver cover of The Ink Spots (a creepy R&B band from the 40s).

When I opened Spotify (PC-Win) today I was asked to fill out a quick survey. I suggest everyone takes a few minutes to rate truthfully and type in a comment about some of the features that are now missing.

Hopefully this method will get back to the development teams and they can start pulling their heads out of the sand and reintroduce some features that were removed.

Unequivocal Proof that Spotify's Radio feature embarrassingly and literally plays the exact same songs in the same order.,"http://imgur.com/a/bl0EL

I kicked off a radio station for Kayne West and took screen caps of the play queue that spotify generated. I skipped to the last song in the play queue and took screen caps of the next play queue that loads. I repeated this until you could clearly see things start to repeat in the EXACT SAME ORDER. 
 
In the list above, by the 7th screen cap you can see that the songs from the first screen cap are being repeated in the exact same order except for one song. 
 
Try it for yourself! Open up the play queue and take screen caps of it. Go to the last song of the play queue to load more songs and take screen caps of those. See how long it takes for Spotify to start repeating things in the same order. Why even have a radio function at all if you're only going to repeat a small subset of the millions upon millions of songs you have?!

Instructions to import music from Spotify into Google Music and say goodbye to Spotify,"Here is how I imported my music from last.fm and from Spotify into Google Music. Post here if you need help.

**To import from Spotify playlists to Google Music:**

1. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/jlund/spotify-export
2. Convert the output to match the format of https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist/blob/master/ExamplePlaylist.txt
3. Use gmusic-playlist to import to Google Music: https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist

A video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA4JRCL7d-Q

**And as a bonus...to import last.fm tracks into Google Music:**

I've never listened to any Spanish music on my account, it shouldn't think I understand what they're saying or that I'm interested in this music. I even went through all my playlists and made sure I removed anyone that sings in Spanish such as Pitbull, Camila Cabello, etc. I've hit 'thumb down' on foreign music when it comes up, but it's frustrating to do it multiple times each day.

&#x200B;

I've never had an issue with foreign languages, but now when I hear a Spanish song, I want to flip my desk. I've stopped hanging out with my Mexican friends because I'm afraid of them influencing my Spotify playlists just by proximity. I live in Southern California and now avoid my favorite taco trucks. I caused a 12 car pile up on the freeway trying to thumb down a Spanish song that came up. I broke my wrist and both my legs at the gym trying to change the song. I've never supported building the Trump wall, but if it could influence my Spotify playlists, you've got my vote. Spotify is turning me racist, real talk. I didn't sign up for this!

Religious playlists every Sunday?,"Just wanted to bitch and complain how much I hate that every Sunday spotify turns all religious and slams playlists like Top Christian Tracks, Praise & Worship, Country By The Grace of God at me.

Calling all Playlisters!,"Hi r/Spotify!

I work for Moledro Digital (http://www.moledrodigital.com), a digital marketing agency based in London. We work with a range of labels, publishing companies and independent artists including Capitol Records (home of Sam Smith, 5 Seconds of Summer and Karen Harding), Fiction Records (home of Kaiser Chiefs), Good Soldier Songs (home of The 1975 and Huntar) and the up and coming independent artists Alyusha and Ebson. 

One of the services we provide is Playlist Plugging. Essentially, we pitch tracks that we’re working on to relevant playlist curators for them to consider adding and to get their thoughts on the track so that we can let the artist/label know how the playlist community is receiving it. Playlisters matter and that’s why we want to hear from you. 

Later this year we are going to be hosting showcase events in the city featuring live performances in unique venues. This will be a great opportunity to introduce playlisters to labels, artists and fellow playlisters all whilst having a good night out.

So, if you own a playlist (big or small) and would be interested in receiving new music, merchandise, gig tickets, job opportunities and/or information about exclusive events for playlisters then please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BjCAKPrC4M4MIGNEKl5trR5Lzni0A9EFgtrVpL8wZi4/viewform). 

Please pass this message on to anyone you think might be interested. If you have any queries about any of the above, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Why I am not going to pay for spotify anymore:,"When I first heard about spotify, I was instantly intrigued. All my music can go everywhere with me for less than $10 a month. Can't beat it. 

So I tried out of the free trial, and I loved it. I knew after a day of using the paid service I wanted to keep paying. This was literally the greatest thing to happen to music since the electric guitar. 

So I let my trial period expire and got ready to buy, but for a day or so, I had ads because, like I said, my trial period ran out. 

Dat ads tho. 

Spotify has the BEST ads ever. They have ads that bring new upcoming artists to the spotlight, ads that let you know about release dates for records, etc. 

I want to pay for the service because the service is amazing, but I want to be able to hear the ads when I want. So I email the support team at spotify and pose the question ""can we premium users have a way to enable ads if we so choose?""

""We currently do not have that feature,"" was all the response I got. 

Meh, whatever. I'll just pay for it anyway. And I did. I paid for it for over a year. 

With the whole target holiday fiasco, the wife's and my debit cards were changed out, and the auto pay for spotify was gone and our premium ran out before I realized I had to change it over. So yesterday, I'm listening and I realize I have ads again....... and then it happened. 

I heard an ad for gamefly where spotify ""CUSTOMERS"" get 6 months free. 

A customer implies that person has paid for a service, yet all the paid members of spotify are left out of that deal because we don't hear the ads!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?

So now, until I get a way to enable ads, I am going to use the free service because I can still get all my music wherever I want, at any time.

Clearing the air about the new UI,"
People calm down it's not the end of the world. 


I have been using the new UI since march or April now and here are my thoughts.


Major changes I've noticed


Saved songs -
 now show up as liked songs
No real functional difference here all your songs are still saved your song library is still safe.


Now playing screen -
Its heavier i believe so I'd recommend turning canvas off in the settings saves data and prevents lag.

One good addition is that now playing queue button shows up at the bottom so it's much more accessible then before especially on taller devices.


Now the inconvenient changes.


Artist tab - it shows just the artists you've followed.

Now I've always followed most artist whom I actively follow (have multiple songs by them) but earlier if you saved a song from an artist they would also show up there like all normal offline players.


While it makes sense cause i had way too many artists there earlier so it's easier ti get to favorites now.

BUT it greatly affects 2 things


I. If you're accustomed to browse your music through artists you'll have to spend a good amount of time following the artists.

(I've read in some threads that people uesd artists tab get to the songs they've downloaded from that artist and i have no idea how they did that artist tab has always only showed the most popular songs by that artist and all their albums and singles on my device

Now i don't use artists to navigate my library so I might have never seen this option)


II. It does affect discovery as i would some times check out other music from that artist while going through the artist tab which now is not possible



Albums-
This I agree they've ruined it. Partially saved albums don't show up in the albums tab so most people would probably have <10% of their library here now

And unlike artists you cant just go around and fix this.


Now the fundamental change here is that earlier when you saved an album all the songs were added to your saved songs so some times an album would clutter your Library. ( I love listening to film scores and would save them but then I ended up with over 20-30 songs that I don't want to come up in my regular shuffles so i had to make playlists for that)

Now saved albums aren't linked to liked songs so if you want to listen that album just go to the albums tab.


This no link approach means that your saved songs can't get added to the albums tab and that does create an issue if you primarily use albums for navigation. Something that I used to alot in the beginning.



I'd like to say as hard as this transition is the way to go is make playlists I've been doing that for 2 years and it has some advantages over artist or album based navigation 



But Spotify devs definitely did not think this through and the backlash is more than justified.


Stay strong and don't give up hopefully all of this backlash will make them listen to the community more.


Feel free to list other changes and any mistakes that i might have made in this.

PS I don't think the new UI is any good either. Spotify has never been perfect but we've made it work and now they've literally taken away the methods we used to make that happen. 
And if it really is making your music experience miserable you can download an older version from apkmirror.

Rant - Spotify is not content to be a great streaming service.,"I liked spotify a lot when I first startedd using it, and I've grown more and more frustrated with it as the years have gone by. The UI has gone from good to passable. When I open it, I am shown playlists I don't want to see or even know about, and there's no way to customize this. I was really frustrated for a long time with Spotify shoving their own playlists in my fucking face like I give a shit, playlists complete with pastiché, gross names, and corporate imagery, and then it hit me: Spotify does this because they don't want to be the best streaming platform out there, they want something else - to be the arbiters of MY taste. They want to control the whole game. I can't even play my music without having to look at their bullshit, even if I pay subscription. fuck off.

To be fair, the algorithms that generate ""New Releases for you"" ""Discover Weekly"" ""Tastebreakers"" and the year end data/review playlists are cool.

Counter-opinions welcome, obvi.","[""I've tried all the main streaming services and like it or not, spotify is the best balance of quality, playlist curation, and availability.

They're both quite different in feel despite offering the same basic play-whatever-you-want foundation. I also give AM credit for a much clearer UI. I personally can't stand that Spotify wants me to shuffle play EVERYTHING seemingly (the big green button is almost always Shuffle, which I just can't understand, especially given I pay for Premium.

How about issuing user-friendly '**Release Notes**'  to the users email address in conjunction with with every update, so we know what we are in for in terms of the changes being made?

And, how about allowing users to have an option to create '**Restore Points**' or some other mechanism so that we can roll back to a previously loved version of the app?

Spotify Rant,"This is another rant, but I hope I’m adding to the discussion.
Spotify is my favorite app.  I’ve got 16 gigs of songs stuck on my phone, so it’s not like I’m going to stop using it anytime soon.  I’ve been an advocate of the streaming service for a year now, always telling my friends about the product, turning them on to it.  However, it’s hard to be a proponent if the product itself is changing in ways you don’t agree with.  Really, it’s just the changes made to the interface, and I think basically everyone else here has agreed for the most part.  Whether it be the removal of two tabs at the bottom of the screen, or the moving of the repeat and queue button, Spotify has lost the seemlessness that drew me to the app in the first place.  In this day in age, we are on our phones constantly.  Things need to be quick and simple when it comes to an app’s interface, especially for the apps that are used the most.  Having certain buttons like the queue and repeat on command should be a given, considering how much we (or at least I) use them.  I don’t know if their doing some sort of study on their app to see what people use and don’t use, but I know that I use those buttons like crazy on the app.  What do I not use?  The green heart.

Is Spotify something I should be spending my $10/month music budget on?,"I recently took the Spotify offer of 3 months for $0.99/month and I'm honestly already thinking of cancelling. I'll list why but I'm curious if anyone can rebuttal any of my points or add anything to my points. I may also list a few positives.(Indicated with a + or -)  


TL;DR: -Terrible queues, -sucks for free users, -don't care about artists, -broken features, +/-support annoying to find but fast and respectful, +Discord integration, -lightweight.  


**1 - Queue is terrible on both mobile and PC**

Great, I have a list of all the music that's going to come up but I can't return to a point in the queue without spamming the ""previous"" button? Seriously?  
I know there is a history section on the PC app but I found it just replaces your current queue with that one song. Perhaps it's just not working (like a few other features I've tried to use) but I haven't been able to find any issues with it.

&#x200B;

**2 - They don't care about free users**

I only upgraded to premium because of the offer but my experience with the free version was pretty terrible. I had **no** idea about *why* I should upgrade except to make it less annoying. They didn't try and sell me any features or anything, they just threw as many annoying ads at me as they could. The ads weren't even original either!

&#x200B;

**3 - They don't care about artists**

I expect quality music from the artists I like. I don't enjoy listening to artists like Drake or whoever else there are like him. I enjoy music from people like S3RL, anyone from the Monstercat family and Infected Mushrooms Psytrance. While some of these artists are big enough they likely don't rely too heavily on streaming service revenue, others are not. They don't pay artists anywhere near well enough, especially indie artists. Why do premium streams get artists more revenue than free streams?

&#x200B;

**4 - A few features I've tried straight up don't work**

I'm specifically thinking of the ""Devices Available"" tab not showing any devices while it clearly knows I'm listening on my phone. The integration they have with Discord will update when a song changes on my phone (as long as Spotify is running on my PC). I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling and even resetting my phone but nothing worked. I would contact support but....  


**5 - Support is terrible**

Not the people, the people are lovely and I'm thankful for them but the way it's set up is horrible. The only, and hopefully last time, I used support was when my account was deactivated for some reason (I got emails about it, followed the instructions but it still got deactivated????). I had to go through numerous redirects to find a support I *didn't* have to log in for. That being said....  


**6 + Support is fast**

The one time I had to use support, my issue was dealt with very quickly and the person helping me was very kind and patient with me.  


**7 + Discord Integration**

I game quite a bit so it's nice having a feature where it shows what I'm listening to on Discord and I can invite other users (sadly they also must have premium) to listen with me. Problem is, I wouldn't have known about it if I wasn't there when it was implemented.  


**8 + PC app uses very few resources**

I don't have the most powerful PC and I do enjoy playing quite a few games that I *need* every frame I can get per second. The app being lightweight and easy for my PC to run (and actually functional) is appreciated.

&#x200B;

Please feel free to add others or rebuttal my points. I want to make an informed decision and maybe we can help others do so as well.","['If you cancel, would you start buying the music directly from the artists, or just stream on the free version of Spotify? Let’s be honest...it’s $10 for a whole month, that’s barely two coffees or .33 a day. ', ""1.

With Spotify, if I think I am going to need queue features, I just make a new playlist and treat that as the queue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Not sure what to say... Music isn't free.  If you do not pay with cash, you pay through advertising.

"[Idea] A cheaper type of paid subscription, in which there still are ads, but you can choose your songs on mobile + some features (maybe offline tracks)","Since the recent ""Spotify mod shutdown"", there's been a lot of talk on the issue.  

Essentially, Premium gives:  
- offline tracks  
- the ability to choose songs on mobile  
- no ads  

Meanwhile, the Spotify mod had:  
- the ability to choose songs on mobile  
- no ads  

I, as many users, am not that bothered by ads.  
I'd really like it if Spotify made 2 versions of paid subscriptions: Premium + a cheaper one (you choose the name).  
With the cheaper version they could give us some features and leave the ads.  

*I know that MANY of you on this sub are probably REALLY into music, so a 10€ / 10$ subscription may not be much for many of you for a service you use A LOT and for a hobby you really care about.  
But, for occasional music listeners and/or for people with A LOT of expenses (for medical reasons, family reasons, etc.) those 10$ per month can be a burden.  
And so these kinds of people ended up searching for ""alternative"" solutions like Spotify mod.*

- help Spotify increasing is paying customer base  
- help occasional music listeners contribute legally to the music industry**","[""Yeah, but i still don't want to pay for something i already have legally for free on my PC and PS4.
