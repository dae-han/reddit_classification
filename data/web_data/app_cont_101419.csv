Been using this app since day one and I can honestly say it's the worst Apple software they have done. 

My issues are as follows:

When I travel and change my time zone to be in sync with the local area all my offline saved music is deleted. Why?? I was on a flight recently and I changed the time zone so when I landed I'd be good to go, but I had no idea that by doing so all my offline music I saved for the flight was gone. 

It's just so random this app. At times it will be flawless, however the offline playlists are the worst thing imaginable.

I tried & I failed,"Gave Apple Music a go for 10 + months. Hadn't created a new playlist during my time with it and only added about 20 songs to existing old existing playlists that i had migrated from Spotify using STAMP.  I became more and more annoyed with my habit of isolating myself to the same few playlists, eventually I started using YouTube to listen to music instead of the service I was paying for.... \*sigh\*. Realized i had done goofed myself.

&#x200B;

What had happened to my music habit....

&#x200B;

My old Spotify library consists of more than 40 playlists that i made myself, with more than 10k songs divided amongst them. I used to quite enjoy my music sessions while programming. Often i would use the radio functionality to discover new music in genres i liked, add em to playlists and kept following that white rabbit for days on end, expanding my musical horizons. My playlists became more and more refined allowing me to discover great new music at the press of a button.

&#x200B;

Tried using the @love functionality, tried the suggestions apple music came with. It was so bad, even with all my Spotify music merged into the library from the get go. I might've used the app incorrectly aka. ""holding the phone wrong"".

&#x200B;

Now I'm back on Spotify for the first time in 10 months, its only been a couple hours. Found at least 5 new songs that are playlist worthy. It just works, straight of the bat listening to new songs, enjoying myself again. UI so intuitive, radio functionality much wow, Linux client, web player.... Do i need to keep going?

bye Apple Music

"Lossless, Lossless, Lossless.","I've really tried to convince myself that Apple Music's sound quality is adequate since it's the most seamless streaming service but I can hear a difference on the music I'm most familiar with between a lossless copy ripped from a CD (or from Tidal hi-fi) and the version on Apple Music. On one hand I am an audiophile and do spend my money on a audiophile gear and opted for the Harman Kardon sound system (while I realize I may notice the difference more so on a pair of headphones as some audiophiles consider even high-end factory car audio systems to provide average sound o_O) in my vehicle so I can appreciate the difference. On the other hand, the majority of listeners are totally ok with even lower quality than Apple Music, or listening with EarPods. But once you go lossless you don't go back. It's the drum beat hitting harder and sounding more detailed, it's the guitar having a newfound fullness to it, it's a treble that's crystal-clear and well-seperated, it's vocals coming through with the clarity of the lead singer being in the room with you as it feels like you're surrounded by a live band. Jay-Z and Tidal aren't wrong by stating that lossless is more about the emotion: you get all the sound frequencies rather than a compressed experience, it simply feels better.

My theory has been that Apple is waiting to introduce a lossless music option as a way to to tout a benefit to the removal of the headphone port, so I can wait till September but I could very well switch back to Tidal and pay double just to enjoy my music. Once you go lossless on a quality pair of headphones or a high-end sound system, songs just won't feel the same compressed.","['I will tell you what Spotify told me when I asked them about a feature they were missing: ""You are in a minority and we don\'t care about you.""', 'I never understood this obsession with getting lossless audio quality. \n\nI doubt 99% of people would hear a difference.

But Apple is not going to want to spend all the money necessary to provide lossless only for the vast, vast majority would be completely unable to tell and complain that it's murdering their data plan.

"Apple Music, not quite for me.","As most of you, I was so exited to test Apple Music as soon as it came out, but I realised it was not what I though it would be. I'm not gonna write a rant on why I'm ditching out of Apple Music, but instead make some lists with the pro's and cons I accounted.

First of all, I want to make clear I wasn't used to any other streaming music service before. I briefly tried Spotify (but didn't like it), so my opinion is not biased by this. I am mostly and iTunes user.

**Things I liked about Apple Music.**

* Discovering new music: The ""For You"" category in the beginning wasn't very good picking playlists for me but in a short time it developed great playlists with a lot of moods and new music for me to discover. I think this is the function I used/loved the most.

* App design: This one for me is a strong point, since this is the reason why I mostly don't like Spotify, but with Apple Music things are easier to navigate and over all it's a more friendly UX/UI.

**Things I feel neutral about Apple Music or can improve**

* Beats One: The station is fresh, keeps playing new music but also occasionally throws into the mix old good songs. The DJs seems cool and are nice to the ear. But to my taste it plays waaay to much rap music. I think this is a good effort but music is too diverse to match everyone's taste into a single station. I'd love some more rock oriented station and DJ's.

* Music Variety/selection: I find myself listening to a lot of music through SoundCloud or even YouTube, there's some music that I can only listen exclusively on YouTube because I cannot find it anywhere else. I hated Spotify because I could never find most of the songs/artists that I loved and I thought Apple Music would be the solution to this but apparently I have too dark tastes. 

**Things I didn't like about Apple Music.**

* Setting up: When you use the service for the first time, this bubbles with different musical genres pop up and you have to figure out what to do with them. The system is not very intuitive. It took me a little while to figure out how it worked. Also, since I was setting it up from my iPhone (4S) it didn't worked properly, I could accommodate just some bubbles. The musical genres picked up for me were awful. Since I'm in Mexico, Apple must have thought I liked Reggaeton, Spanish Pop Music, Salsa, Ranchera. I don't even have those genres on my playlists or music. When I wanted to add more genres they wouldn't come, or the same one would keep popping over and over. Then on the next step the artists were also so far from what I liked, and It never showed me artists I really liked. This was a very bad first impression.

* Managing music: I use a Mac at work and another at home. I have different mp3 playlists in both. I used to own an iPod Classic where the playlists from my home computer were synced. When I set up Apple Music at my home's Mac it asked me if I wanted to sync my playlists with iCloud, I thought this would be a good idea but it wasn't quite. Sometimes Wi-Fi on my office is quite bad, so when I tried to listen to Apple Music Playlists it would lag terribly or sometimes wouldn't even load (lucky YouTube would work/load just right over the same bad Wi-Fi signal, ha!). Then I wanted to find my original playlists (those I made in the office with mp3) but since all playlists synced it was very hard to find such music within the large library of online music mixed with everything else. I never found a way to choose ""offline music only"" on iTunes, so I had to disconnect my Apple ID entirely from the office iTunes' Mac.

* Apple Music on iPhone 4S: I know I have an old phone but since the service was made available to my device, I should expect it to just work right (Apple was [is?] very good at that). On my iPhone sometimes I wanted to add a song to my library but it wouldn't let me, so I had to make a playlist and then add that song to the playlist in order to make it available offline on my phone. This method sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. When I plugged my phone in the car and wanted to listed to Beats One many times it wouldn't load me the station. Also when plugged sometimes it played some random songs that I listened recently without even making a playlist for it. It took very long to load songs and I felt it like a hot mess.

Finally to summarise it all, maybe streaming music is not quite my thing, I don't know. But I felt the cons were higher than the pro's. Maybe it's the shitty internet connection on my country, or my old Phone. But overall I didn't felt a great benefit from the service. I know this is the first attempt from Apple to make something like this, but I'm used to great quality coming from them. This time it didn't just felt like that.

I think I'll keep discovering music through reddit (there are some great music subreddits, check them out!) and sticking to the good ol' infalible mp3. Until then, I hope Apple Music is really *For You*.",0,0,1508.0767141145136,apple_music

Just look at the different Netflix cateloges in different countries.  \n\n> Take Doctor Who for example.  BBC Wales Produces Doctor Who, BBC one has the rights to air it in the UK, BBC America the rights to air it in the US.  Then BBC Worldwide has distribution rights after it has been on iPlayer in the UK and I think BBC America/Worldwide has something going on with their distribution rights in the US.\n\n> So in the US they have a deal to put more recent episodes of Doctor on Netflix more quickly than in the UK, where they withhold it from streaming so push DVD and digital sales.\n\n> Or another one. Community, Yahoo had the distribution rights in the US, but in the UK it was some shitty Sony channel no-one had heard of.  And because it aired on Yahoo Screens, you can still watch it there in the US, but in the UK they immediately put episodes on iTunes to purchase after it had aired on Sony.\n\n> And that's just the face of it.  They are so many content deals underneith all that that will affect it, even to the music that is used in an episode or film.  Producers will have to strike deals in all terriroties as to how the music is used. Is it just going out live on TV? Will it be distributed, if so how? DVD? Streaming? ... all those different options will cost different amounts of money, and will be up to publishers in different terriroties to negotiate.\n\n> I wouldn't put it passed Apple to *try* and do a video streaming service.

Apple music is an afterthought,"Honestly this app is a messy glitchy piece of shit. I don’t care how many updates they give to it, it’s been 2 years since this trash launched and you still have bugs that have been in this app and not addressed since day one. I guess since they can get their $10 or however much they you pay for this crap a month, they don’t care. 

Why after ios 11, a slight cosmetic makeover, and the addition of social features am I still getting “Unknown albums” after I delete an album? Why is that album art and title still there undeletable ? Why is the hell is it that when I delete purchased music off of my phone, in the iTunes store when I go to download something, I have to find out for some reason it’s been sent to hidden purchases?

Seriously, for a trillion or how ever much dollar company, Apple sure stumbles on the dumbest shit. Maybe instead of trying to shove a U2 album down people’s throat, you can go an get your fucking team to fix these stupid bugs that no company with the visibility and market hold as Apple, their products shouldn’t even be seeing.

Limited would be a certain number of songs and albums offline a month say 10 or 15 albums or 1,000 songs offline.

Apple Music Student Discount UNFAIR!,"I'm rather perplexed and I apologize if this issue has been addressed.  Although I have been  researching for seven days and I cannot find a reasonable answer. 

Regarding Apple Music Student Discount, I understand the logic behind their qualifications and not permitting certain institutions. However, Apple Music decided only four-year institutions offering a bachelors degree, only those students qualify for the Apple Music Student discount.   
How did they come to that conclusion? 
If they say they're following the guidelines put out by UNiDAY. I have been corresponding with UNiDAY and have been informed the guidelines have been set by Apple Music 
In fact, I have been told by UNiDAY, the subject is no longer up for discussion, which brings me to writing this....
Apple has their hands in so many charities around the world and it's admirable they are willing to help students with an Apple Music discount membership.  

What I do not understand is why Apple Music opted to penalize students going to a community college? 
A community college that receives the same funding as the public four-year institutions. 

Any student attempting to obtain a higher education should qualify for the student discount. 

If Apple Music attempt was to follow any type of government guidelines for accredited higher education, I understand there are some on-going battles to determine what constitutes accreditation.    CHEA.org Council for Higher Education Accreditation for example is trying to eliminate technical schools et al.  

I found a comprehensive list put out by U.S. News & World Report: EDUCATION. Their list is only comprised of non-profit, with only federal, state and local funding. 
May I suggest this list as a guideline? 
The two-year community college students are borrowing money to pay for their Apple products to help with their education just as much as the students at the four-year schools.  

Apple make products to help students and for those students to become business owners, with all Apple offers, charitable and otherwise I cannot imagine Apple wanting to dismiss or penalize this small population of students 
","["">What I do not understand is why Apple Music opted to penalize students going to a community college?\n\nWell, then, let me help you understand: Apple isn't *penalizing* anyone.

Then you go on (for seven days calling standards boards - wow - according to you) splitting hairs over $3 extra dollars per month because you feel as entitled to that discount as those of us who pay for a 4-year degree at a regular college/university. And then you rationalize this whole thing by saying Apple should do this favor for you (oh, and stop *penalizing* you) as it's some sort of investment in you purchasing more products down the line once your Community College degree gets you that high-paying job as a Business Owner™.\n\nsorry to be the one to tell you, but your whole position is ridiculous. it may suck a little that you don't qualify for the discount, but your whole position that they *owe* it to you, that you're somehow being *penalized*, and that you spent *this much time and effort* trying to figure out why is just outrageous.\n\nmove on."", 'I love that you are a student who is making a huge deal out of not getting a discount on entertainment.

Moved to Spotify,"After 3+ years of Apple Music I’ve decided to switch to Spotify.

Here are my reasons:

- Library: Apple Music would often make my library a mess by splitting albums/compilations. 
If you decide to delete/re-add an item to clean up the library it would remove it from any playlists you have created. 

I haven’t come across this problem on Spotify and have noticed that there is a lot more care taken on an artists page. Probably because they prioritise the streaming service. When I visit an artists page I am rarely presented with several versions of the same album like on Apple Music and when I look at the artists music I have in my library everything has an image and looks complete. 

- Community - I like the idea of curating playlists, sharing them and gaining a following whilst searching for new music. Although this is achievable via Apple Music I feel the community isn’t big enough at the moment. 

- Algorithms - My main goal is to listen to new music. I would listen to my ‘New Music’ playlist from Apple every week and it would be very hit or miss. Even if I knew an artist had a new track out and have all of their material in my library Apple Music would often miss the obvious choice for the playlist.

So far after adding my library to Spotify I’ve been recommended some great new tracks and find navigating through similar artists to stumble across something new is much more enjoyable.

- Integration - Mobile, desktop, tablet, chrome cast, PS4, smart TV. Spotify seems to be available everywhere I need it. 

—

What I’ll miss from Apple Music:

- Beats1: I will miss listening  to Echo Chamber, Time Crisis and The Alligator Hour 😕

- CarPlay: Apple Music works really well with my car via CarPlay. Library displayed on dashboard etc.

- iDevice Compatibility: Owning a few Apple devices I liked that everything is in sync across the devices. 

—

Negative things I have noticed in Spotify - 10,000 song library limit.
This really surprised me. When adding my Apple Music library across to Spotify I got a little carried away and decided to add more/all albums by each artist. I then reached a limit and was not allowed to add any more. You can easily save albums as playlists for each album but that could get messy.
Lots of room at the moment but hopefully this is something Spotify addresses ASAP. 

—

Every year when Spotify releases its stats and the community comes alive I often think I’m missing out on Apple Music and decided to jump ship this year. 3 months for 99p/£9.99 also helped attract me.
Any body else been getting a little fed up with Apple Music?

I’ll let you know if I come back 👍🎧","['You can’t upload your own music (at least not easily and without extra effort) to Spotify - that’s a non starter. \n\nAlso, when I select “Artists” and scroll to their songs, I need to see all their albums, not a giant mashed together list of their songs. \n\nFinally, on the web player which I used at work, clicking “Artists” only shows you a list of artists you “follow”, not s list of artists in your library. \n\nSpotify is too playlist centric. I’ve long said it’s better for people who just like listening to playlists and one off songs. If you have a big library and you also like to listen with purpose, or if you have your own tunes not offered on a streaming service, Spotify is the last one I’d choose. \n\nDisclosure - I subscribe to both and listen to Spotify at work as I don’t need to install anything local on my PC', '> Any body else been getting a little fed up with Apple Music?\n\nYes. But i feel that the choice between Apple Music and Spotify are a bit like choosing between the plague and cholera. Because there\'s positives and negatives with both of them. As is it with Tidal and other services. \n\nThe sad side of it; is that it looks like the only winners are the music services. We as customers can\'t find a service that\'s ""more than decent"", and the artists are still receiving ""next to nothing"" regarding payment.\n\nI\'m currently looking at Tidal myself. The $19.99,- HIFI quality are brilliant and much better than both Apple Music and Spotify. But it *is* ten dollars more a month, and the app(s) are unstable and; in lack of a better term; total crap when it comes to usability.\n\nSo i\'m probably staying as an Apple Music user when i\'m done testing. Mostly because i don\'t feel like moving all my music ""one more tedious time"".', 'I monitor my library about once a month for any changes.  I will sort my songs in iTunes, delete the ones that have been moved around, and add the original ones back.  I use smart playlists so, after rating the songs, they automatically get thrown back into all my playlists.\n\nIt is a pain but Google Music also did this to me, I can at least monitor it in Apple Music with iTunes. I like Spotify’s interface and recommendations but I will never use it until they fix three things:\n- Remove the dumb way 10000 song library/download limit. I have a device with 512GB of storage (my work phone has a combined 1TB of storage). Let me download all I want and make a library as large as I want.\n\n- Bring back the ratings system for paid users. Spotify thinks that liking a song is the same as adding it to your library, it’s not. The way I use Apple Music, Google Play Music, and YouTube Music (though that’s out on pause until Google fixes their things) is I add an album to my library. It’s in the recently added section where I will play the album. The songs I liked are given a heart or thumbs up and automatically added to a smart playlist. My “Best Of” playlist is downloaded to my iPhone for offline listening. It’s up to almost 13,000 tracks and yes, I’ve listened to every song at least once. I will shuffle that playlist when I just want to sit back and listen to music. No constant internet connection required (so it’s great when I go on vacation) and it requires little maintenance. Spotify used to do something like this but they took it away. I am not going to manually manage a 13,000 song playlist.\n\n- Let paying users actually upload missing content. The way Spotify does it now is just awful. I shouldn’t have to be connected to the same wi-fi network as my PC running the Spotify program just to listen to Tool on my devices and smart speakers. Not when I’ve uploaded their collection to Apple Music and Google Music so I can access it on anything I want anytime. Even Deezer lets people upload tracks and it’s something that Google is working on with YTM.\n\nIf Spotify fixes those three things, I would switch over in a heartbeat. They do a bunch of things correct like the app and program interface, song recommendations, and library/playback analysis. But the problems I listed are huge for me, it’s how I’ve been managing my library since 2002 when I purchased my first iPod.

"Adding Entire Playlist's Contents to ""Songs"" in Library? (plus ranting about Apple Music's design)","Let me begin by saying I am completely confused as to why the Apple Music library is formatted the way it is. It is very confusing to have the ""Songs"" and ""Playlists"" tabs both be considered in my ""Library"". Clicking ""Add to Library"" on a playlist just adds a playlist to my ""Playlists"" tab, not my ""Songs"" tab. This functionality, although confusing, is fine, but my problem arises when trying to add the entire playlist's contents to ""Songs"" (This is all on my iPhone 6, by the way, currently updated to iOS 12). 
I can ""Download"" a playlist, but this doesn't add the songs to my ""Songs"" library, just makes the music playable offline. Also, when a playlist is downloaded, songs within no longer show the + next to them to add them to my ""Songs"" library, making it even less convenient to save from playlists (although I can still long-press on a song and click ""Add to Library""). So, I have a few questions:

* Am I missing some way to add every song in a playlist to my ""Songs"" library? Do I have to manually add EVERY song to my ""Songs"" library? (I tried enabling ""Add Playlist Songs"" in settings and adding a playlist to a new dummy playlist -- no luck, didn't work)
* Is there a way to automatically save every song placed within a certain playlist to my ""Songs"" library? (becomes frustrating when adding new songs to an old playlist, but I don't want to enable it across all playlists -- some playlists are meant to be kept separate from my ""Songs"" list, so I don't want to enable the global ""Add Playlist Songs"" setting)
* If these functionalities (because of some very flawed designing) do not exist, is there a way to use a Shortcut to add every song in a playlist to ""Songs""?

I'm just disappointed with the lack of separation between ""Playlists"" and ""Songs"" in my library and lack of functionality within Apple Music. Sometimes I want the two categories to be separate, while other times I want a playlist to add its contents to ""Songs"" automatically (or at the very least be able to easily add all songs within a playlist to ""Songs""). The ""Songs"" tab should be renamed ""My Library"", and saved playlists should just be in their own separate place entirely.

Music not available on Apple Music that I own doesn't sync.

Family plans are a mess. Finally got 1 member to work. The other didn't want to take at all. Plus members have to use my credit card to buy apps instead of using their own - unless they want to use gift cards. Bizarre.

Making playlists in Apple Music via iTunes doesn't sync to the iOS Music app, resulting in wasted time.

Editing playlists in the iOS music app doesn't work. I put songs in a particular order and the app simply snaps back to the way it originally had it.

Can't select multiple tracks in Apple Music to add to a playlist in iTunes. Adding them one at a time is for the birds.

Having to enable iCloud Music Library just for Apple Music to work is plain redundant.

"Later, Apple Music. (For Now).","I'm a Music buff. I'm an Apple buff. Apple Music was this combination's love child which I was counting down the days for. Unfortunately, it hasn't hit the mark (yet). Clunky experiences, music going missing, and blowing my data out of the water. After weeks of frustration attempting to build my personal collection, I've returned to Spotify. And honestly, the returning experience is incredible in comparison. Spotify's UI is just flows, and everything just *works.* You drag and drop into playlists, you follow friend's jams they've put together. So, for now - see you later Apple music. I'll let you sit in the oven another couple of years. Let me know if you're feeling the same way!

TL;DR Tried Apple Music, couldn't cope with the frustrating UI.

The ones they offer are too short. And I can't 'follow' a playlist, I need to add all the songs to my library, which clutters my 'My Music' views big time. "", 'Honestly, I had more problems with Spotify than with Apple Music. I hated the way Spotify handled local files - it was clunky, there was no gapless playback, and I couldn\'t upload my album art correctly. Being able to listen to local files is HUGE for me, because I have a lot of music that\'s either out-of-print or simply not available for streaming: old jazz records, experimental music, local bands, etc. \n\nFurthermore, I love Apple\'s handling of playlists. Let me clarify, though: I don\'t use playlists as collections of disparate artists and genres. I\'m more of an album guy. I use playlists mainly to organize large albums - for example, a 10-disc collection. Sorting it with playlists allows me to easily listen to the discs that I want without having to download the entire collection. For that purpose, Apple Music is miles better than Spotify.\n\nAnd: I\'m able to edit metadata! This is big for me. With Spotify, if they had accidentally screwed up a title or artist, I had to accept it. With Apple, I can change it easily.\n\nThe biggest problem I\'ve had is with matching, but I\'ve since developed my own fine-tuned methods for ""force uploading"" my music so that Apple doesn\'t try to match it. I\'m almost positive they\'ll be fixing this functionality within a few months, anyway.\n\nSo, I really like Apple Music and I\'ll continue using it and paying for it, because FOR MY PURPOSES it\'s much better than Spotify. If one uses these services to just listen to playlists and relatively mainstream music, however, I can see how Spotify would be better. ', ""Came to the same conclusion today. Spent hours over 3 weeks trying to build my library, adding one album at a time and cleaning up as I went. Watched as live albums, after renaming each track to make sure AM didn't confuse it with the studio track, uploaded. Watched the progress bar, iTunes registered it as uploaded. Then I listen to the tracks on my phone and somehow they have been matched in the cloud to studio versions. Old studio versions matched to bullshit re-recorded versions.

I tried it out when it first came out and it was pretty rough around the edges but I put up with it because it was rev 1. Decided not to sign up. I just signed up again today and played with it for an hour or so on my iPad Air 2 and am simply in a state of disbelief that it's this bad. 

I tap an artist I like and many times I get a blank page. Totally white, maybe with a Follow button. Sometimes I get some of their albums, but for some artists not all of the ones I know are available. I tap an album, hit Add to Playlist, New, and sometimes the tracks are all blank. No titles, no art. Sometimes they're ok and I have to type the album title and hit Done. Go back to Playlists and hit Apple Music Playlists and the list is empty. Kill the app, repeat, same thing. 

Hitting hearts often does nothing at all, doesn't even light up. Add to My Music and it doesn't show up in the list. The list goes on. What a mess.

Where exactly is Apple Music not worse than Spotify?,"I started my AM trial a few weeks ago and so far it's the worst streaming service I've ever used. I switched from Spotify because of a bug that causes high data usage for already-downloaded tracks and so far that's the only thing where AM was better at. So far I've got this list:

- tracks take a while to start playing
>Spotify plays them instantly

- recommendations are the worst: I listen to Neurofunk DnB and it throws cheap Dubstep at me. I listen to Future house and based on that it recommends me some Justin Bieber remixes. I listen to trap (the ""real"" one before some shitty rappers kidnapped the term) and it thinks I will probably like some whiny autotune pop-rap.
>Spotify somehow knows how to separate genres, puts 5 great, 5 good and 20 bad tracks into my Discover Weekly

- apart from the absolutely abhorrent recommended ""My New Music Mix"", the only way to discover more songs is to play some handcrafted playlists that hardly match the music I am listening to. (or albums which are just as bad). Obviously a hand-picked selection can't satisfy everyone's needs but why not automate it?
>Spotify doesn't have GREAT algorithms that deliver individual playlists but at least their algorithms are GOOD enough

- stations often just don't start 
>Spotify at least tells you that the track hasn't been played often enough to deliver recommendations

- music stops when it stops
>What? When the playlist ends, Spotify just goes ahead playing similar music (that is actually similar) so, again, some really good recommendations.

- no public user playlists
>Spotify offers you to make your playlist public which is a great way for labels to get their music popular. Apple already buried one social network, now they are trying to connect users with artists instead of connecting users with other users which makes much more sense.


Now I am wondering why anyone would prefer Apple Music over Spotify. Are you actually more happy with it? The only advantages I've seen so far is that it doesn't use mobile data when you tell it not to do and one day I got a really good oldschool hip hop playlist but this was like 2 weeks ago, haven't had a good one since.

Apple releases more and more broken stuff but AM really shows where this company is going and I can't believe Tim Cook allows this to happen, Steve probably would've eliminated the whole development team for f*cking up so bad.

Wow! Mediocrity multiplied! No smart playlists! No star ratings! No song sorting! I feel like I'm back in 1995. 

Every few months I check out AM because I really want to use it. I've catalogued my music using iTunes since the introduction of the iPod. The iTunes software still has more bells and whistles than all the current apps out there. Apple had the best product. But now they're lost in some simpleton landscape that puts their streaming app in 3rd place, at best. Please, please just emulate iTunes and you'll have my money.

Apple Music is confusing,"So, this is a situation I see all the time...

Music from my library is supposedly Matched with the iTunes database. 

Browsing around playlists inside the For You section I come across a playlist which includes tracks Matched with my library.

This seems good on the face of it but it is in fact, a little confusing because some of the these “matched tracks” have a little plus on the right hand side, as if to invite me to add these tracks to my library. 

This issue isn’t even consistent, sometimes it’s there, sometimes it isn’t.

I appreciate any help!","['I have been using Apple Music for some time. I just recently decided to go back to Spotify (hadn\'t used for a couple years). Big mistake. I am a simple person and the Apple Music interface is simple to me. I also have been an iTunes user for years. I guess it was what I was used to. Spotify\'s interface is a mess. Too much clutter for my tastes. I also hate that everything is based on a playlist. I save an album, make a playlist. Again, I may be set in my ways, but Apple has once again makes things ""just work"" for my needs.', ""Spotify is generally recognized as having better recommendations/discovery for new music you would like to find. Playlist centric rather than artist/album centric. Spotify also generally works better on all non-Apple hardware.\n\nApple Music is better for curating and organizing your own library, and you can upload much, much more of your own music easier to the cloud to integrate with the service. Artist/album centric rather than playlist centric. Apple Music has many millions of more songs available. Apple Music generally works better on Apple hardware. \n\nThe above highlight the main differences. It depends on what you use, and what you want out of the service that will determine which is better. For me, Apple Music is better as I use HomePod, iPhone, and Mac, and my very large library is very important to me. I like the fact that more music is available to me on Apple Music, and music discovery, Apple Music's main weakness, I expect will only improve over time as algorithms are updated."", ""Well it really comes down to your listening style. I'm a library style listener and make playlist just for events and hangouts. Spotify is more playlist based and library organization is horrible.

This can be from playlists that the Spotify team create for everyone, for you personally (Discover Weekly, Daily Mixes & Release Radar from artists that you follow and/or artists they think you'll like) and playlists created from other users. Spotify also does allow for playlists to collaborate as well so if you've created a playlist and want your friends to add songs to a playlist for an event or so you guys can recommend songs for them to listen to, you can do this. Spotify is a mess when it comes to local files so if you have leaked tracks, demos or even songs that were officially released but not offered on Spotify, it's a pain to upload them locally.\n\nApple Music I find is much better for users who want to organise their music library and wish to listen to albums in full, instead of listening to songs randomly hoping to find a new good track. Whilst both services offer playlists created by the company's, I feel as though Spotify does this better, helping users to achieve that new next hot track. However, like I said Apple Music is better for people who wish to have an organised library, and this is where AM really exceeds. You can edit tracks and albums metadata from the service to however you wish. Also tracks that have been leaked or from mixtapes and aren't offered on AM is easily (when it wants to work) integrated by using iTunes. \n\nSo really it does come down to how you would use a service. They both offer trials though, so check them out. I find that I like both of them and will happily continue to pay for both.

Alexa/Apple Music,Wtf! Why does this not work. I mean it works but why tf is shuffle feature not work. Absolutely unacceptable. I can’t believe Apple or Amazon would release a in finished product. So disappointed. I understand it’s the first version but this is some BS I’m returning my echo. Was considering switching from google to Alexa. I think I’m gonna stick with google. ,"[""I'm going to break down this post and hopefully get somewhere with it. \n\nAppleMusic on android has always had issues - it's no joke. There is conspiracy to believe this is intentional as Apple would like those on other operating systems to have a worse experience in order to get them onto their OS. However I disagree - AppleMusic is a separate income source from Hardware to AppleMusic and I do feel they just do not have as big a team behind the Android Development space as they do their own, and it takes a backburner. I feel by polishing the Android and showing how well it works - they'd actually get more subscribers and more people tempted by their Hardware and OS. \n\nWhen AppleMusic was released it was a very basic streaming service, it has now matured and is getting better with each passing month - but there are things that need updating. When it came to the HomePod release, the Apple branded AppleMusic Home Speaker, it was awful too and really needed work and with software updates we have seen that. \n\nWith Alexa, I suspect releasing on Alexa was part of the conditions to the deal Amazon and Apple have made to selling First Party Apple Goods on Amazon again - remember when Amazon removed all streaming sticks like the Roku and Apple TV from Amazon to ensure people could only buy the FireStick on their Site? \n\nI feel in this instance, Apple wants to increase online presence and Amazon is the worlds largest marketplace, so they made some compromises and released this half baked integration. That being said, I feel they will update and polish the experience with time - so give it just that. It's a new release, it's going to be slow. \n\nIf you would rather use Apple Music, don't go for a smart speaker - go for an AirPlay enabled actual speaker, you'll get decent quality and can just stream from any OS Device instead. It'll be a much better experience all around - plus you won't have amazon spying on your every conversation in your house.

Apple Automatically Replacing Songs with Different Versions Without User Consent,"So this previously happened to me with a jazz piece by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. The song ""Maria"" was replaced with a slightly different version. When I say replaced, I mean totally without my knowledge and I only discovered it when the song came on and I thought it sounded rather odd. I'm very particular with my music and I can tell when there's a slight difference. This affects which version of a song I choose to put in my library when there are multiple sources to pick from. Needless to say, I was very upset for two reasons. First, the song I added to my library and got used to hearing for months is gone. This is still at least somewhat understandable on Apple's part because, after all, Apple Music is a streaming service which is dependent on record label contracts and you should expect this sort of thing every once in a while. However, I was not only upset because of this but more so because, without my consent or knowledge, Apple Music replaced my previous selection with something different. Granted, they didn't replace the jazz song with something totally unrelated but just because it has the same name doesn't mean it's the same recording. Again, I'm particular with my music, I like certain recordings because they sound a particular way and Apple tried to hide the fact that my selection became unavailable by changing it and that's not okay with me. Imagine taking out your favorite blu ray and when you pop it in the player, you notice it's a slightly different version of the movie you own. No one told you they tampered with it and replaced it to hide the fact that the original is gone. Not good.

Just now, I realized that the song ""Shooting Stars"" by Bag Raiders was replaced with a remix. This is even worse and is just unacceptable.

If record label contracts/deals with Apple change and certain songs that were previously available are removed or re-uploaded into the database under a different album, while that's already annoying because of a lack of consistency, I would appreciate it if Apple wouldn't also go and replace my selection for me after the fact. They've gotten it wrong twice already and this is a paid service which I use to keep my devices full of music for periods of time in which I can't afford to hook up to the internet and search around to get back certain songs. At the very least, if the song is no longer available, Apple Music should just notify you that the version you previously added to your collection is gone rather than replace it with something else.

My music library is sacred. Apple used to be a company that understood this. Going in and tweaking my song selections is a big no-no for me as a customer.

Has anyone else experienced this?",['Yes this is a (very) well known issue. Part and parcel of the way Apple Music matches your local music library with Cloud versions.

 Music will not play songs unless I add them to my music.,"I have several playlists that I listen to frequently. I often use the radio as well. Last night I went to search for a song that id heard on the TV and when I tapped it to play, nothing happened. I began picking random songs and I can't get anything to play. The now playing screen will pop up but after a few seconds it closes itself. 

Nothing is saved on my phone. I stream everything. But I can play any song that is in my music library. If I try to play a song not in my library, it will not play. Then I can add it to my library, and it plays. Curious, I checked my other devices. This same crazy thing happens on my  iPad, my  TV, and my mac. 

I've searched and searched and I can't find anything about this online. My subscription is current and I've never had problems previously. Does anyone ANYONE know wtf is going on? I've reset the phone. I've logged out of iTunes. Restored the firmware....Nothing. I'm getting pretty aggravated at this point.

MAKE AVAILABLE OFFLINE,"Honestly, where do I start.

I had around 100Gb of music downloaded to my iPhone, some of which was there before I subscribed to Apple Music. I got up to drive to work one morning this week, plugged my phone in as usual and selected shuffle on a 600 track recently added smart playlist, after around 30 minutes I noticed that I had just listened to the track that was currently playing so I click next and that had just been on too, same again, same again.

When I arrived at work I opened my recently added 600 track smart playlist and it all looked to be there. Again I tried to shuffle the playlist and it was just skipping through multiple songs until it reached on of the tracks that was repeat playing in the car.

After messing around with the only show tracks available for offline listening function I re-opened the playlist and there was only 11 tracks there!?? After getting frustrated I decided to delete all of the music from my device and start again when I get home, my plan was to wipe all of the music from the device and re-download my 600 track playlist again.

So I delete all the music from the storage sections of the settings app, go to 'about' in the settings to check the data has been deleted form my phone and to my surprise I have 13Gb available and 100Gb taken up!?

So now I have no music available to listen to offline but 100Gb apparently taken up on my device.

I have re-tried downloading the playlist and it appears to try to download 500 odd tracks but again they are never available to play when I'm offline... Unbelievable really.

Anyone else experiencing anything similar to this or am I on my own in a world of storage loss and unavailable music?

* the ability to ""heart"" a song or album.
* the depth of the catalog they had for a particular artists.

**Dislikes**
* the repeating curated playlists...after the first 3 or 4 weeks, there weren't any new lists, but just the same reordered ones.
* the lack ability to easily manage the songs on my iPhone.  Trying to add songs and take them off is entirely too difficult.
* replacing songs that I have placed on my songs with different versions of the song.  I want to have the original version of the song rather than the ""rerecorded"" version, thank you!
* in ability to easily access the songs/albums that I have ""hearted"".

As a strong supporter of Apple, I decided to give Apple Music a try. It is also favorable to me to adopt Apple Music as my streaming service of choice due to system's bias. It was very exciting initially despite interface glitches...

Pros:

* integrated into iOS
* known to have exclusive right to stream certain, popular songs on demand
* known for its exclusive content from artistes
* music videos
* more than just music, but podcasts and music-related videos
* diverse option of playlists for everything, of artistes/genres/popularity.
e.g. artiste's favourite, inspired after artiste, etc.
* lyrics available
* designed for social interactions

And this is the real face:

* **the integration is superficial.**
Apple Music in iTunes on Windows is so laggy that it directly ruins my music experience, and difficult to deal with local music that are mixed with existing Apple Music — (""duplicates"")... it's a nightmare. Audio and music videos are treated as completely separated multimedia files. So if you add same song audio+music video in your library and shuffle your entire library, they will be played separately. This will give unfair probability to songs with music video because not all songs have music video.
* **the music videos are just normal videos from YouTube**
there isn't any difference in Apple Music and the iOS. The OS treats the music video as a video. Which means the music will pause when you switch tasks. It won't be recognised by iTunes Match. And quality (visually) is poorer than YouTube's... seems like 480p only. Audio quality I'm not sure, Apple customer service says there's no audible difference. Even so, it doesn't worth since the size is large.
* **you need to sync music with your phone Library to iTunes Library**
I know this isn't a good point. But from a user perspective, one that argues ""Apple Music is more integrated,"" such statement seems to be an oxymoron. It's outright contradiction of reality. I feel that there are 2 separate music libraries with Apple Music (phone&computer) while I never felt that on Spotify. Other than system bias (the Siri), there's nothing else better than Spotify. In fact because of the tedious syncing, it might be considered ""less integrated as compared to Spotify."" I never need to sync my on-demand songs Library with Spotify to update my newly added songs or double delete. Spotify never required me to plug phone to computer/same Wi-Fi network to seamlessly sync my music libraries and playlists. Syncing may not take much time, but it's very inconvenient.
* **it is difficult to add music to library from playlist**
Somehow your Music Library becomes crucial for your iTunes experience. Unlike Spotify, you can choose to use playlist or library to shortlist your favourite musics right? That isn't the case on Apple Music. This is absolutely fine for me... but I only realised this after I've finished manually migrating all my songs into my Apple Music playlist. It was quite ironic that even though adding songs to Music Library was necessary, the process wasn't as straightforward as pressing the + beside song. Because the + icon will not be available if the song is already downloaded offline (which my entire playlist is). Without those songs in Music Library, there will be no sync on PC and I can't play songs on PC properly. It will also not be organised both on PC/phone. In order to add those songs (I had ticked downloaded for offline for the entire playlist) to Music Library, I've to visit my Apple Music profile on my phone and open my playlist from there. Alternatively, I need to open up my PC and open my playlist from there.
**Edit:** https://1drv.ms/v/s!At2d63nj8IeDlm5cZbM4UZXCpUGN
* **the exclusivity is just for a bragging right** (since it'll likely be temporary, for like 1 week only), and it's rare.
* **the podcasts/music-related videos is just a feature. Nothing much special, all of them are accessible from YouTube.** There are more exclusives tho (i.e. Carpool Karaoke), but I'm confident they'll be available on YouTube eventually
* **playlists? ALL of them are so outdated** (the human curated ones). The automated ones like popularity, has nothing unique except its weight is lighter than Spotify's majestic stats. And when I say ""outdated,"" I mean several years old.
* **no way I can listen to all songs from a specific artiste.** This is so essential. Unlike Spotify, I can visit artiste's profile and click ""Shuffle"" or try ""This Is: [Name]""
* **lyrics only available for famous songs**
* **social interactions? It's worse than Spotify's. I can't see what my friends is streaming right now.** I can only see the PLAYLIST my friend is listening to. If that friend uses Library and doesn't use playlist to categorise songs, I won't be able to see what they are doing at all. And the ""social interaction between fans and artiste"" is just a lie. It works just like normal Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr posts. <--- that's bad because artiste has one more platform to share his/her posts. ---> which leads to inactivity. Even if it isn't inactive, the unthreaded comments is a mess, and all I can do is to ""Like"" artistes' posts, that's all for ""social interaction.""
* **cannot start playlist as radio** Complaining Spotify Radio is repetitive and lousy? Apple Music doesn't even allow you to discover new music based on your songs shortlisted in a playlist.
* **the *For You* recommendations is obsolete.** **This is my personalised recommendations:**

> - Too Good at Goodbyes (by Alex Goot)
> - Galway Girl Mashup (by Michael Constantino)
> - Wolves (by Sofia Karlberg)
> - Call It What You Want (by Andie Case)
> - Malibu (by Fly by Midnight)
> - Friends (by Matt McAndrew)

Horrible right? **↑** If you aren't a POP listener and don't understand what happening, basically Apple Music recommendations are based on my most listened songs' REPLICA.

Let's say I like Galway Girl by Ed Sheeran. Apple Music (according to the above), it would recommend me Galway Girl Mashup by artistes from nowhere. It's the same song as the original Ed Sheeran's Galway Girl. Or Friends is just a replica of Friends POP by Justin Bieber.

**PS:** The cons is endless. They are mentioned because of their priority. I left out miscellaneous things like buggy welcome fav artiste selection, difficult to find friends, glitchy help find friends via xxx (e.g. Facebook/Instagram,etc., it doesn't seem to work properly), you cannot quickly toggle stream phone/PC. A workaround for this is Remote app, which allows you to play music on computer from phone remotely, but it isn't integrated into phone's Music all-in-one. And as such it increases complexity.

**Edit 2:** In response to those who are negative on the tone of this post, I've written one post clearing the misunderstanding of the purpose of this thread. The purpose of this thread *isn't rant,* but a *wake-up call* for the Apple Music community that AM isn't doing fine. It's underperforming as a decent music streaming service.

Perhaps make iTunes JUST about music, have a separate app for movies, and another for syncing iPhone content.\n\nAs to being unable to add music to your library that\'s already in a downloaded playlist I can do so by taping the ""..."" for each individual song in the playlist and selecting ""Add to library"".', '> it is difficult to add music to library from playlist\n\nClick the ""+"". Not so difficult?\n\n> Somehow your Music Library becomes crucial for your iTunes experience. Unlike Spotify, you can choose to use playlist or library to shortlist your favourite musics right? That isn\'t the case on Apple Music.\n\nNot sure what you\'re saying here. You can choose to subscribe to a playlist (in which case the contents could update dynamically) or you could add the entire playlist or individual tracks to your library. Or you can copy the playlist as it exists to a personal playlist in which case it won\'t change.\n\n> This is absolutely fine for me... but I only realised this after I\'ve finished manually migrating all my songs into my Apple Music playlist. It was quite ironic that even though adding songs to Music Library was necessary\n\nIt really isn\'t.\n\n> the process wasn\'t as straightforward as pressing the + beside song. \n\nYes it is.\n\n> Because the + icon will not be available if the song is already downloaded offline (which my entire playlist is).\n\nIf that\'s the case, the file is already in your library.\n\n> Without those songs in Music Library, there will be no sync on PC and I can\'t play songs on PC properly. It will also not be organised both on PC/phone. In order to add those songs (I ticked downloaded for offline for the entire playlist) to Music Library, I\'ve to visit my Apple Music profile on my phone and open my playlist from there. Alternatively, I need to open up my PC and open my playlist from there.\n\nI honestly have no idea what you\'re saying here. The integration between Apple Music and my personally owned and uploaded music is fantastic and easily the best feature for me. I think you don\'t understand how it works, or you\'re missing some UI.\n\nI know that My Music Mix is weird and unreliable for some people but for me it\'s been amazing.

Long story short, part of the agreement was Jobs (Apple computers) could use the name as long as they stayed out of the music business.

I've got over 100GB library that's constantly expanding and years and years of listening habits that are constantly evolving. At this point I figure Apple knows my musical tastes better than me. The For You feature seems to validate this. It's incredibly accurate in terms of my liking what it suggests, and has helped me discover tons of awesome new artists – as well as buried favorites. I love this feature, and the editorial team's copy is spot on and makes for great background reading. But if you've been streaming for years, Apple Music is prolly gonna take a very long time to get to know your tastes and satisfy your expectations for a solid personalization service. If you switched 100% to Apple Music it might still take 6 mos to really get to know you. \n\nMy suggestions:\nBesides hearting songs, their algorithms most likely give a lot of weight to repeats of tracks, artists, and genres, For You playlists you've hearted or plus'd, and tracks/albums/playlists you've plus'd or saved for offline. It might also take into account any Beats1 radio you listen to - genre and track info. It'll also probably add negative weight to any patterns it finds in your skips. Another thing, don't be shy about spending ten minutes training it in the onboarding experience where you tap once to like and twice to love artists and genres. That's a direct rip from the Beats app – which was super good at figuring out your tastes. If u skipped that or didn't go deep I'd revisit it. \n\nHope this helps!\n"", ""In the for you section if you don't like a suggestion you can hold down on the album or playlist and a pop up screen will give you the option at the bottom saying I don't like this suggestion. "", ""I think the love button is the only officially documented way to improve suggestions, but I'm sure they take other things into account. And yes, I get popping and skipping on my phone which can be really annoying. Sometimes the song will just skip right to the next one after playing it for a minute.

Is it time I call it quits on Apple Music?,"I gave Apple Music's free trial a go last summer and liked it enough to pay $10/month for the service. I was having no issues. I did sort of debate if it was worthwhile; what particularly got me was that I would be forced to maintain this payment for my whole life if I wanted to keep my collection of music. But alas, I gave it a shot.

Since that time, I've moved to a more rural area (which is where I'm settling permanently, might I add) with an internet connection that leaves much to be desired. Seems to be at some point after the move that I've started having trouble with Apple Music. My two biggest issues are:

1) Sometimes due to the poor internet connection, I have trouble downloading songs. Sometimes it doesn't work at ALL. Yet the Internet may work for other things. Just not Apple Music. It just seems to not download, period, rendering the music inaccessible. 

2) A lot of music has become greyed out. This includes some of my personal music and also my adds on Apple Music. If I have wifi, it's not so much an issue, but when I'm on the road (which is where I do most of my music listening), a huge chunk of my music will not play. I have to keep pressing ""next"", sometimes 10 times, before I get to a song that plays.  

While I have a good little music library built up, it is seeming less and less worthwhile when I can't access what I am paying for. Anyone live rurally and have similar issues?  

Thanks!","['Your problem sems to be your Internet, not AM.', 'Well your thing about the greyed our songs are because you’re probably not fully downloading those songs for offline listening. When you add a song to your library you have to hit the cloud that pops up. This will then make it listenable offline.', ""Your first issue: Yeah, Apple Music on slow internet sucks. For that matter, almost any streaming service will suck. I know that YouTube Music gives you options to stream/download music on wi-fi at low quality. This may be something you want to look into. Spotify may give you that option as well. Check out a Spotify free trial or the YouTube Music free trial and see if these problems still happen. It can suck to switch services, but it's better than having no music at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour second issue: I believe, due to licensing, that Apple has to check your downloaded library every now and then to update what music should be available to your per any updated licensing with record companies. The problem may be that Apple can't get a good connection through your cellular network, and thus it can't really make these licensing checks, and thus it automatically grays out your music as a fail-safe (even your personal uploads). This could explain why you don't have this problem on wi-fi.\n\nSomeone can correct me on that if I'm wrong, this is just my best guess, and I'm not really certain about any of it.\n\nI hope you get the issue resolved. Fortunately there are a few other streaming services you can check out. Perhaps you'll have better luck with those services."", 'Have you tried restarting the device?

A few newly discovered songs,"

Been listening to the single **Blood on Me by Sampha** pretty much on repeat since last night. The [entire album](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/process/1138217713) is just really great new wave R&B. 

Nas came out with a new album from Kanye’s Wyoming Compound collection.  [NASIR](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/nasir/1399800981) has 7 Tracks, and they’re all great. **Cops Shot The Kids** is crazy. Love it. 

**Go by Louis The Child** is a song I can’t believe I missed when it came out. Fun and catchy electro (the best kind of electro, imo). 

I put these and a couple more new songs on the [Buzz Tracks playlist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/buzz-tracks/pl.u-0rqxsWoxekP):

The Black Keys El Camino is now on Apple Music! Can't believe they finally got it to happen,"Wow, looks like my instincts were correct about Apple taking on the streaming industry. Theyve got the money and the industry history and thus influence to make streaming services THE place where people listen to music, and thus THE place that artists want their music on.

Stuff like El Camino not being available on Spotify, none of taylor swift, and lots of other stuff not being available, or coming months after release. 

El Camino is now on apple music, and this is sign of the trend towards Spotify losing more and more rights to streaming, and losing revenue. Theyre currently growing, but as Apple continues to fix bugs and enhance the features, they will seriously disrupt Spotify's business. 

In turn, this will mean Spotify is making less money for themsleves (theyre already suffocating), and have less to pay out to artists (Apple already is paying out higher than the rest of the industry because they have the money to do so), meaning even more people will pull their libraries or latest albums or not release on Spotify at all. 

I think the industry should stick with the integrated solutions. Google Play Music and Apple Music for their respective platforms, both of which are available on competing platforms but not as well integrated of course. Apple Music is coming soon to android. 

I just hope Apple adds the 2 or 3 things that Spotify has advantages in for now, which I expect them to. My instincts have been right so far. And my instincts say that Apple has user @ handles for Connect not becasue people desperately need to express themsleves when they comment in Connect (nobody cares about the Ping re release), but rather because Connect is going to be an important platform that theyre going to build up. 

It's already got a Soundcloud-like portion, which is fantastic. An artist can post a demo or unreleased song or a studio recording session teaser, and itll show up in their artist page with the rest of their music, rather than needing a separate soundcloud app or website that is disorganized and casual. 

The Ping-like portion is dumb like I said, nobody cares.

Next part they need to add is public playlists. You should be able to search for someone's @ handle and get their 'profile' where you can see playlists theyve made public. Currently, you can only send a link to your playlists, but they cant be found by any user on Apple Music, and they cant be live updated or collaborated on or anything. I understand apple doesnt want people's playlists to be searchable in the regular search portion, because if someone is into BDSM or something and has a playlist for them and their spouse called ""WHIP ME"" or something, maybe Apple doesnt want their official library to include that playlist. I get that. But at least mirror spotify's social playlists by letting people view them by finding your username, and allow collaboration option. 

Although, I gotta say, finding playlists on apple music by mood is weak. On Spotify, id search something very specific, like ""90s college party"" and there would be one. A long one. One you could put on for an entire party, hand picked by someone who threw a 90s party and picked out the perfect songs and vibes. The best you can hope for on Apple Music is finding a 90s classics playlist, which would probably be about 15-20 songs long (when I make my party playlists, theyre 100 songs long every time. about 6-7 hours, which means theyll last exactly the amount of the party or at least wont have to find a new playlist an hour in). So I do think that they should have a section to search for user-curated playlists. It would be separate from ""Playlists"" in search results. It would specifically say user curated ones. 

And the only other thing is Spotify's ""Connect"" feature. Basically Handoff/Remote combined in one. Handoff isnt supported by itunes/music app at all, which is strange, but im sure it's coming up in the next version of iOS/OS X. However, the implementation is key. Spotify does it over the internet, rather than bluetooth/wifi in proximity. This means that my phone can be on 4g and my macbook can be on wifi, and it'll all just sync up over the cloud. 

Tapping the Spotify Connect button on iPhone shows the Macbook as an option of where to play the audio. You can tap it, and the audio will switch over to your macbook and start playing out of that. It's terribly glitchy, it loses your queue spot and changes up the shuffle and everything, but it's nice that it doesnt require bluetooth and wifi. Ideally apple would do it the same way, over iCloud, but without the glitchy and poorly implemented handoff behavior. 

Also, there's remote. Remote for iOS has not been updated yet to support Apple Music. I suspect this is because they either have a huge update to the remote app that isn't finished yet, or theyre building the functionality into the Music app like Spotify, so it'll be an OS level feature, instead of an extra app. In Spotify, no matter which device youre on, the now playing screen/area shows the same thing. Even if audio is playing out of your macbook, your iPhone shows whats playing on the macbook. If you tap a song on your iPhone, the now playing area shows that song as playing on both your iPhone and macbook, and the audio continues out of the source youve selected (macbook). So it lets you play songs and manage queue all from your iPhone, but have it all be playing out of your macbook. 

If the music app on iOS had a ""remote"" button, that would be satisfactory for me. It could even be a 3d touch thing, where you could peek at what's playing on your macbook, and if you like it, pop in to press play or press handoff. Handoff would happen over iCloud like i said, and it would be included in that remote screen. 

Somebody more talented than me photoshop this please.. Basically, you could have a ""now playing"" on your macbook, with an up next queue all set up, but none of that is on your iPhones Music app. So you tap the remote button, and pull up your macbook's now playing and up next queue, and you can either control it, or switch it to your phone, so that your phone is now playing that, and the up next queue you set up is synced over too, or if you had an album on shuffle, itll sync your place in the album, which is also part of the up next queue (in Spotify, you are unable to modify the queue on a shuffled album. Only queues that you manually created).

I think this is all Apple Music needs to be the dominant service, besides getting that android app out there, and a web app, and generally continuing to fix bugs/refine the ux. Any additional features they add over time will just be icing on the cake. If they add these ones, itll already be #1. With Siri, a better Up Next function, and a superior unified library and advanced library management functions (editing metadata and other cool stuff), and a much more extensive library ui that just looks nicer and highlights artists better, Apple Music is already setting itself up to be better at the basics. Now they just need to implement Spotify's advantages in a better way (the way I described) and refine everything, and then continue improvement.

Once Spotify thinks it can't get any worse for them, and theyre desperately doing whatever they can to get users back and get a revenue they can survive on and pay artists with, Apple will use the student discount part of their contract to pull over those last few student stragglers who said ""I cant tell the difference. both services give me the music I want and I dont care about the features. im used to spotify and it's half the price"", who will then just go for the easier integrated solution for the same $4.99 price. 

Spotify only has 30% of its users actually paying. I expect that as Apple Music expands and becomes more dominant in the public eye, the only people using Spotify will be the same 40 million people who are currently using Spotify Free. They dont care to pay for music, but they dont want to illegally torrent. They dont even want to pay $10 or even $5 a month. They dont care that there's ads. Their other option is just to listen to radio stations in terrible quality with ads and announcers, so Spotify free is better than the next worst solution. These people will stick with the free service, while anybody who has the money to choose, will pick Apple Music or maybe google play. 

Those 20 million premium users will turn into 19.. then 18.. then 15.. then 10.. then 5, then 1. The free service may still be maintained, but there's so little revenue in that, and the payouts are much lower, so more artists will not want to put their stuff there. 

**TL;DR Sorry to any Spotify fans who just think it's more refined and stable right now, but those are things Apple can and will work out. Failing revenue and a mediocre 3rd party team that clearly doesnt care about the details like the library, or the queue, or having a good mobile app, are not things that will work themselves out. Theyve already worked out the bugs and instability mostly (I didn't use spotify in the beginning, but im sure it wasnt perfect at launch. No baby comes out a fully grown adult), but that's the easy stuff that comes with time and development/maturing.**

The harder stuff is money/influence, getting things right, and having integration and good apps.","['Holy novel, Batman!  Can I get a TL;DR?

I just responded to /u/quat1e ‘s question regarding Spotify & AM. Turned into one hell of a rant and I thought I’d come to the community to see if it’s user error more so than AM shortcomings.,"Below is my response to u/quat1e ‘s question. I’ve edited this answer shortly so it makes a bit more sense.

If anyone has any suggestions please let me know - I really wanna make AM work but rn I’m pretty frustrated and disappointed. I haven’t even gotten to music suggestions yet.


I’m 1 day into Apple Music after 2+ years of daily use on Spotify.

I expected some teething problems but honestly not the ones I’ve had.

Just to give a quick 101 of the biggest things I’ve noticed (again 1 day in so perhaps I’ll find a work around)

1.	No way to easily (if at all) ‘Follow’ an artist - so in situations where you find an artist you like or find an artist you’d like to explore more later but you aren’t 100% committed to their music being apart of your offline library yet? Yeah no way of putting artists in that space on AM
2.	The initial Artist/Genre Preferences - the AM process is hideous, balls that you leave small for don’t mind don’t hate, tap once the ball grows for Like, tap again ball grows again for Love. However, if you don’t like an artist you have to tap and hold for 3 fkn seconds. So when AM sends you 10 bubbles with 4 artists you like it takes a long fkn time to remove the other 6 you don’t. I ended up skipping this process just out of sheer frustration.
3.	You’re unable to easily (if at all) reset your preferences after you crack it and skip artist/genre selection process. Fml
4.	When you play an Album of a band on Spotify if you have the ~online radio~ feature on (I think) once you’ve finished that album by that particular band it’ll go on and play bands/songs with a similar sound/genre. This is a big no no from AM. It’ll just play the album then stop.
5.	The artist radio function on AM is just artists’ songs not a collection of music by different artists.
6.	This is more of an Apple Watch X Apple Music X iPhone frustration; There is no way to turn on shuffle from the ‘now playing screen’ (iPhone Or Apple Watch) - so you want to play one of your playlists, you’ve selected it from your Watch and it’ll start playing the playlist from the top. No worries (it’ll play from the top on Spotify too and you need to phone to shuffle)  just head over to my iPhone ‘now playing xyz by zyx’ okay no shuffle button from this screen - drop down now playing you’re now in some random arabic band that your travels took you to 3 hours ago. Back back back back ah scroll scroll scroll ah alas my playlist - I’m really enjoying this song I’m now halfway through it would be a shame if you had to hit shuffle and just start another song in the playlist right now! - AM lol

Yeah so 24 hours of Apple Music this is where I’m at, I made the switch for 2 reasons - Apple Watch & Family Sharing as we have 4 of us paying for streaming services.

I’m not a coder or programmer by any means but I’m certainly not tech illiterate and if these features are available they aren’t readily available . I’ve even conducted several google searches for what I’d imagine to be ‘simple functions’ and still nothing.


But honestly if I don’t see/find improvements in the short term then yeah I’ll probs go back.","['switch back to spotify. apple music is set up for established, longer term, deeper album based listening, which is why 4 is happening. i don’t know why five is happening - i’ve been an am subscriber since beats and that’s not how radios work. i’m listening to the smiths radio right now, and i have heard the cure, new order, siouxise sioux and public image since my last smiths song. \n\ni have a first gen apple watch so i don’t know about that.\n\ni do find it weird you wouldn’t finish instructing the algorithm for a service you are theoretically using every day, no matter how annoying. you only do it once. \n\nthere are tons of things about apple music that are extraordinarily important to me, but it really is a music service that is oriented towards a much more active and established style of listening. it’s not the best for finding new artists, but it is the best for going super deep for things. and the way am treats genres that are difficult (rap, especially, and electronic) is fantastic. my mixtapes aren’t used as a punishment/count against me.\n\nyou don’t have to use apple music if you don’t want to, and it sounds like your music listening style doesn’t work with the way apple music wants you to listen, so switch back. we don’t work for apple  or anything. \n\n']",3,250.59162152577605,apple_music

Kidneythives,"Hey AM users


Can anyone help me out with finding more music like kidneythives, it can be from all eras.

I’m also trying to avoid the “soft core” female rock bands like nigthwish,and the “epic/fantasy” feel. 

 The singer don’t have to be female. I guess what I’m looking for is rock/industrial without to much noise.

Tried AM for a week and hate it. How f'd is my library going to be when I cancel?,"So I wanted a way to get a bunch of my songs from Spotify into iTunes to purchase and this was the most straight forward way by using another service to transfer the playlists. Plus I wanted to give AM a try to see if it improved since launch.

After letting it upload/sync my library I gave it a few honest goes over a week and have to say it's just as frustrating to use as before. The icing on the cake was I went to play an album I own, but AM only shows me 5 songs from it because it sells the album but just a few songs off it (but I thought it gave me my music in the cloud?)

I remember it being a bit of a nightmare when canceling before, in that albums and songs would get screwed up but I didn't know if that was still a thing and if there's a way to avoid it apart from just loading a backup of my library.

Thanks.

Apple Music is killing my battery,"So I am really trying my to like Apple Music, but I am having so many problems.

- Add to my music not always working
- Apple watch Siri seems to not work with Apple Music
- Complicated GUI (For me)
- Takes forever to start a song (I have 100mbit connection, Spotify is instant even downloading bought iTunes music is faster I can get like 5 songs downloaded before it starts streaming)
- Apple Music offline mode will not work and this is causing major battery drainage and bandwidth usage, I made a playlist with 2000 songs and set it be available offline, it downloads some then I keep getting can't download, I have to click 100s of times either repeat or ok. I have gotten down to the last 10 songs and bam it starts. redownloading all of them WTF? It also get really laggy when doing this, is it trying to download them all at the same time?

So now my iPhone 6 plus is dead, I usually have around 40 - 50% at the end of the day by the time I get home and if I know my luck when I get in the car tonight it's going to break down, in the middle of no where haha.

","[""You're downloading 2000 songs and you're upset that Apple Music is killing your battery... "", ""Simple. Stick with Spotify. I'm sick and tired I hearing people's disgruntlements.

Typically this would take my phone's battery from (say) 85-90% to 65-70%.\n\nSince signing up for Apple Music, I've been doing the same thing, only playing mostly Apple Music content instead of my own stuff via iTunes Match.  (I'd been playing music via a smart playlist that specifically looks for things I haven't played recently, so while I have no specific data on how much of the music was already on my phone, I assume that most of it had to be fetched.)\n\nSince switching to Apple Music, doing this — sucking music off the network and playing over the speaker, only now sucking the music from a different source — for the same period of time takes the battery down to about 10%.

"I'm disappointed because I thought Apple Music was going unify the listening experience of professional and indie music, but it's still gated.","While I was watching the Keynote, the music industry guy who got up, showed a slide with all these different music services and was talking about how our music listening experience was fragmented. I liked that because I've long had the frustrating experience of going to Spotify or iTunes to listen to commercially produced music, and then having to switch to something else like SoundCloud or BandCamp to listen to friend's and local band's music.

It's always seemed stupid to me. Now that we're all digital, it doesn't make sense that the library is gated. Why do artists have to go through a third party to put their music on iTunes? While it probably generally raises the bar for quality, it just doesn't make sense anymore. And, with millions of users liking and adding songs to playlists, the question of quality should be solvable with algorithms.

So, when Apple Music was announced, and the music industry guy got up there, I interpreted what he was saying as Apple Music opening that gate so that professionals and amateurs alike could have their music found and enjoyed all in the same experience. I was excited. Now I'm bummed out. Frankly, I don't so much care about the 'social media' efforts of big bands--connect--I care about the social media efforts of the nothing-band. I like hearing new music, but I don't like that someone else still has to 'discover' the next unknown thing for me. I want to be able to do it myself.

So can anyone explain it? Why is the library still gated? Why doesn't Apple Music allow anyone and everyone to add their songs and present their projects on Connect?",0,0,1559.5383344892716,apple_music

Apple Music needs Hi-Fi.,"Apple is releasing the HomePod soon, which is targeted to be a high-end Smart Speaker. Unfortunately, this high-end Smart Speaker has to deal with low quality music. I just don't see why Apple doesn't bring Hi-Fi music to this service when they're about to ship something like HomePod. Hopefully, Apple acquires Tidal. They could benefit from Hi-Fi music as well as their Tidal Rising program on top of their exclusives catalog (like Beyoncé's Lemonade).

Will Apple eventually acquire Tidal? Will they offer Hi-Fi? Let me know what you think below! 

While you're here, check out my Apple Music playlist [Bangers & Ballads](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/bangers-ballads/pl.fcb054677ba24261b49f3ee37ed877fa)! 1300+ songs across R&B/Soul and Hip Hop/Rap. ","['A lossless option would be nice. That said, Apple uses bitrates that have only indiscernible quality loss for the majority of humans, even on HiFi systems. Many double blind tests have proven this and you can even conduct the experiment for yourself with relative ease.', 'Honestly if they had 320kbps AAC that would be nice. I can hear some artifacting on Animals by Maroon 5, and some other tracks.', ""That's very true. I wish I could use Apple Music instead of Tidal, but the sound quality is just very poor. "", ""This is the reason I don't use streaming. I know it doesn't matter to everyone (and that's ok), but I want to enjoy the music as uncompromising as possible. So if that means ripping a CD into ALAC/FLAC and listening that way, oh well. \n\nI don't really understand why people want Hi-Fi streaming. Tidal is so pricy compared to a CD, and with services like VOX you can store all your FLAC in the cloud. Also, ownership of your purchase. "", 'I agree, especially with Apple moving into ""high end"" audio with the HomePod. At the very least, they\'re banking on better sound quality as a big reason to choose the HomePod over Sonos or the Echo, etc. I agree that 256 AAC is fine for almost all casual listening, but as soon as you\'re listening on even modestly-good headphones or speakers and paying attention, especially with music with a lot of transient detail (think of the sharp attack on acoustic guitars for example), the limitation of 256 AAC shows up. Even the bump to 320kbps makes a notable difference. Lossless streaming a la Tidal would be the best, though. I saw mention just today that the HomePod supports FLAC out of the box. Interesting...', 'Apple used to be the leader of lossless audio. Now Apple Music does not even support 320kbps AAC, what a joke!! I miss Jobs.']",9,633.2288668968529,apple_music

Apple Music vs. Spotify - I’m torn. Convince me why one is better than the other. Go!,,"['Personally, I prefer Apple Music. I already have an iPhone, Apple TV, HomePod, Apple Watch and Mac. I can have one music service across all my apple devices and everything syncs nicely. I like using first party apps from apple and they always get updated to work better with other Apple products. For such reasons, I have chosen Apple Music and been enjoying it greatly! Still up to you what you like.', ""Spotify = I don't know what I want to listen, give me options\n\nAM = I know what to listen, just give me a way to organize it and sync it through my devices"", 'I use Spotify to find playlists and convert them to Apple Music.', 'Apple Music provides music videos, TV shows/documentaries, lyrics and able to transfer local music files to your icloud music library', 'Siri/HomePod.  That’s the difference for me because I don’t have to pick up a device to add to a playlist or give a rating. I rely on ratings pretty heavily vice “love” or “star” ... once or if they take ratings away it might be a new ballgame for me though. Started on Spotify, used Stamp and transferred everything over.  Spotify has better discovery features at the moment but Apple will catch up.', 'For me I am currently torn between the two also. I always give Apple a chance no matter what and I enjoy both apps very much. Here is my take. \n\nSpotify kills it on discovery and recommendations. When it comes to radio I think it\'s also very good at sticking to the genre and not jumping to just popular songs in that genre. For me I listen to a lot of underground hip hop and modern reggae dub style and Spotify delivers some serious jams. So let\'s say I start ""the grouch"" radio on Apple Music and it will throw a couple good similar underground, but then drake, then Beyoncé and some other popular artist I really can\'t stand will come and then if I\'m lucky the station will deliver a couple underground\'s again, but not likely. If I do this on Spotify it plays stuff I love, if it doesn\'t I can go to that artist page and click never play this artist again. \n\nThen Spotify has the little things like, swipe gesture on now playing to change song, or on the now playing bar while browsing the app. Adding songs to playlist as a double will give your a warning and then comes the home page. I personally thing it destroys the for you section and even the new for you section on 12.3 beta iOS. Keep playing once a playlist ends is also amazing. Basically turn that\'s playlist into a radio station once you have listened to all the songs. Spotify also has a MASSIVE user playlist data base. Literally everything I type in form movies, video game and sports it provides a playlist. \n\nBut what I truly love about Apple Music is the simple UI. Getting to your music is super easy, downloads still go once screen is off,  lyrics, car play never acts up, less battery drain, playlist artwork from iOS device and last but not least. LOCAL FILES is a dream on Apple Music and utter blah on Spotify. \n\nSo if you have a bunch of local files, hands down Apple Music.\n\nIf you want to discover and make a bunch of playlist. I\'d go Spotify.', 'What do you want out of it.', 'I went to Apple Music from Spotify, and I’m going back to Spotify for one main reason: Spotify loads music much faster than Apple Music does. What do I mean by this? For example, I can bring up a song I want to listen to on Apple Music and tap it. And wait. And wait. And wait. Sometimes, the damn song won’t even play. It’ll go on to something else that will play. If I tap back to go back to the song, it’s a gamble: maybe it’ll finally play and maybe it won’t. All I know is that I am driving in my car in complete silence waiting for the song to load. I don’t have this problem with Spotify. I can load up the same song, in the same area where my connection is strong, and that song will cue right on up - no problem! Sometimes I’ll go to the “You” section of Apple Music to see what amazing playlists have been generated for me and nothing loads at all. Or I can pull up the lyrics and wait and wait and wait only to have them error out. It’s frustrating. I hate saying that because I would love LOVE to use Apple Music as my go to music app, but there’s just too many lackluster things that have driven me back to Spotify. If I’m paying to listen to music, I want to listen to music. And sometimes I’ll pull up a playlist on Apple Music, one similar to what’s on Spotify, and half of the songs are grayed out - can’t even listen to them! But there they are chilling in Spotify, waiting for a tap. \n\nJust my experience.', 'Don’t choose. Get free Spotify and SongShift to move the playlists you like to Apple Music account. \n\nBetter UI and integration, Siri activation. High quality Apple Music curated playlists and algorithmic discovery list from Spotify.', 'I converted to Spotify for a few reasons. Apple Music is a bit clunky and unresponsive. I feel like sometimes there is a delay between taps and activation. Album art also liked to disappear a lot. Another problem I faced was that there would be a week or even two weeks at a time where it just wouldn’t let me download anything. In my mind, if I’m paying $10 for 4 weeks of downloading, I don’t want half of that time to be restricted. That’s a waste imo. Also the EQ sucks. It’s just presets, while Spotify has presets and also lets you customize the different frequencies. Another thing, recommendations. Apple Music absolutely sucks at recommending music. Spotify does it soooo much better. Spotify downloads also take up less space on your phone if storage is a problem. I’d suggest Spotify but Apple Music does have some benefits and the decision is ultimately yours in the end.', 'Another thing listed is Apple Music takes advantage of iPhone and other Apple services, like Family Sharing, etc\n\n\nIntegration into iMessage - share songs and directly play them from there.\n\nApple Watch integration - Apple Music can automatically play your workout track when you start an exercise.\n\nSiri integration - you’d be surprised how much you will use Siri to play songs for you.\n\n3D Touch - press and hold to bring up secondary contextual controls.

I however just recently switched to try apple music out, as I have always been an Apple Fanboy.   \n\n\nThe first impression was alright, just what everyone said. Apple Music discovery kinda sucks, but is great for library organization and all that jazz...  \n\n\nThere are other reasons I like Apple over Spotify, but the most recent discovery for me was the ability to sync non-apple music songs to your iCloud Music library!!!!!!  \n\n\nWith Spotify if you had music that was not on Spotify and you wanted it on the device, you had to add the music (Painfully I might add) to the ""Music Library"" in Spotify, then from there add it to your playlist. THEN Sync it on every device 1 by 1 manually that you wanted it on.    \n\n\nWith Apple music, you just add the song to iTunes, put it in whatever playlist you want. and boom. You\'re done. ALL..... I say this again ALL YOUR DEVICES will automatically Sync and Download those songs when they normally do anyway. You do not have to sync each device individually and manually......   \n\n\n  \nSpotify only lets you use 3 devices for offline music. Which means, your PC HAS to be 1 of those 3 in order to sync non-Spotify music. So that leaves 2 devices free. If your PC dies, HDD Crashes, you change PC\'s or whatever reason you no longer have access to the source music the way you set it up on Spotify, you will lose those songs on EVERY DEVICE you sync\'ed it to.  \n\n\nI have no idea on the limit of downloadable content on Apple Music. I am going to assume it is the standard Apple ID Purchase limit of 5, which I use all 5 and so far do not have a problem. Apple music seems to have way more flexibility on multiple devices, and music you have on your own as well... This one feature, by itself, weighs the most to me.

If I liked it enough to get a FLAC copy, I’ll still always have it. If not then no big deal really.\n\nWith local files, I just sync them from itunes to the music app. It’s not very fluid to switch between the two but really it’s not a huge issue, it takes seconds at the very most.\n\nSiri integration for CarPlay would be nice, but I also don’t like to interact with my phone while driving in any capacity while driving so it’s not a huge issue. It’s easy enough to switch playlists on my phone while not in the car or in a parking lot.\n\nOther than those things I vastly prefer Spotify over Apple Music.

Why is Apple Music SO BAD at recommending music?,"I've used Apple Music for years, and since I'm on a family subscription I took it with me when I moved to Android. However, I decided to give a Spotify trial the benefit of the doubt, and in the small amount of time I was using it, Spotify introduced me to a bunch of new music. Once my trial was over, I moved my new music back over to Apple Music, and quickly realized how much I missed the ability to play a radio based on a playlist (because Apple's algorithms are too stupid to use complex information to make recommendations?). I also just noticed that Spotify was much better at choosing songs for me than Apple Music was, and I just have to wonder how Spotify does all this so much better than Apple Music? I get that some people don't see the importance of this stuff but I really like listening to new music. 

Sorry if anyone else has made this rant here before, I'm just pissed that Apple can't figure this stuff out.","['I’m on iOS 13 and Apple Music has been better than ever for me.

On Spotify even the more obscure artists would go on and on and on, with AM the station reverts back to the first song after like 10 songs played.\n\nI really hope iOS 13 fixes these issues, because I really want to love AM and switch over, as of now though I can\'t...', ""I miss that about Spotify too, although AM recommendations hve gotten better.

"Apple music on android has some serious issues, and generally speaking as well. This has to be known","Well you are probably asking if I dislike apple music so much: why don’t I switch to Spotify or google play music? Because apple music has the best pay plan of all music services afaik ($10 for up to 6 people is insane)

     
And why do I have an android? I had an iPhone for almost 5 years (iPhone 4 and iPhone 5) but I grew tired of the limited storage and exponentially lowering battery capacity. That’s why I switched. So while i was deciding to move I noticed that apple music was just released for android and i was happy because it meant that I won’t have to make my dad pay another 10 dollars for an additional music service, but just then the nightmares began. (This is my list of issues, if you have any let me know so I can send them to apple ASAP)


* **First:** No multi disc album support, (c’mon, even the first iPhone supported this) instead it just shows a scrambled list of songs because the app isn’t designed to show multiple discs.
* **Second:** The app downloads album and artist images every time you enter the ""my music"" tab, wasting internet usage. Just make the app save them in the cache.
* **Third (this is a system wide problem):** Downloading. The downloading of music for offline play just doesn’t feel welcoming in any instance of apple music, even on the mac and iOS. The download tab feels incomplete, we need more info like the total size of the download and how much of it it’s already downloaded, also per song information like you see on iTunes on the desktop, otherwise it feels like it’s doing nothing when in reality it is. Also, like in iOS, we need a way to see if a song is already on the device or not.
* **Fourth:** When notifications arrive it mutes the music instead of lowering the volume. It doesn’t even pause it.
* **Fifth:** Weird cracking when a song ends and some interference from the previously played song when jumping to another (when going to songs not already in the queue)
* **Sixth:** Haptic feedback. I noticed that the whole app is designed in the android aesthetic (and that’s excellent), only one thing is missing, and that is the haptic feedback when tapping on anything.
* **Seventh:** Not being able to go to a previous song outside the app (rly?). in the notifications drop down thing you can see what song is playing and you can pause it or go to the next one, but not the previous one (srsly?). Also scrolling through songs outside the app and even on the lock screen would be a really nice feature.
* **Eighth (Another system wide issue):** library corruption, this has been a major issue ever since apple music was released. Some songs get scrambled and mixed between live versions and album versions or the order is mixed, and this is still happening. And if one device is affected by this iCloud does the wonderful job of spreading the chaos to all your other devices. (It’s not iCloud’s fault as that is what it’s supposed to do, but because of these issues it just becomes a pain in the ass)
* **And finally:** allow us to use external storage to store the cache and downloaded music for offline play. If piracy is your concern might as well encrypt the entire iTunes folder on our computers. Every song is already protected by drm so it doesn’t really matter if they can be extracted as we can already do that on pc and mac and we can’t get through drm anyway. This is one of the main reasons I switched to android (and even if this is done just so we can’t use this feature that’s kind of rude &gt;:c), so please let us take advantage of it.

Only two people in Apple Support even knows what the personalized playlists ARE,"I was an AM subscriber in 2016-2018, then switched back to Spotify early this year when I moved to Android. Still not a fan of Spotify, so I switched back to AM about six weeks ago. I still haven't had the personalized playlists pop up, so I reached out to Support to ask if there's an issue, when to expect them, etc. So begins my hellish journey.

* The first agent, through email, had no clue and simply said they were the wrong department, please contact a different department.
* The second agent, through chat now, has no clue at all, tells me I need to log in to iCloud Music Library on my Mac. That's already on, so I ask if he wants me to toggle it off then back on again. He says yes, I do it, and he literally says congratulations, problem's fixed, now my music will sync across devices. I tell him that's not AT ALL the issue and reexplain. He says he doesn't know, call tech support, asks if everything is solved, ends the chat.
* Third agent, on the phone now, simply has no idea at all what the personalized playlists are and thinks my For You tab entirely is not showing up. I tell her no, just the playlists. She doesn't know, throws up her hands and escalates it.
* Fourth agent again has NO CLUE what I'm talking about so finally I just pull up a screenshot on Apple's support site of what the playlists look like. She screen shares in to look at my iTunes and I show her the screenshot from Apple's website. She tells me what I found ""in some article"" isn't relevant here and because it's an iPad in the screenshot, it's doubly not relevant because they'll appear different on different platforms. She still has no idea what I'm talking about and says since my For You section is working, there's no problem. ""It's different for everyone because it's FOR YOU."" She's getting really testy with me at this point. I compare Apple's playlists to Spotify Discover Weekly to let her know what I'm talking about and she says ""let's not go outside the Apple ecosystem here"" so I say ""right, but that's the best analogy I can give you as to what I'm talking about. I ask if there's a timeframe I can expect them to show up and she says no. I say, ""so what, like three months? A year? Two years? When is this actually considered a problem in Apple's eyes that an advertised feature that USED TO WORK for me is not working now?"" And she snidely says ""I don't have a timeframe for you."" I ask to speak to someone else and she's very resistant but finally switches.
* Fifth agent finally knows. It takes him a minute to understand because the last person really poisoned the waters, explaining that the whole issue is that my For You section isn't working. After a little while, I ask him if he knows what playlists I'm talking about and he says yes, that Apple has no support documentation on how to fix it though, and says we'll need to move up again.
* SIXTH AGENT now.

Six agents over the course of TWO HOURS. Four agents had no idea what I was talking about at all. One was generally familiar but unsure what to do. One knew exactly and knew exactly who to bring it up with.

I'm done with AM and Spotify,"Both of these services, IMO, do not offer what I need. I've used them both for a total of 2-3 yeas each, and opened multiple tickets with Apple Support.

AM is the best for putting your collection in the cloud, but is constantly rewriting metadata/editing albums/changing music due to contract issues. It has ok music recommendations. So its bad for people who have large, organized collections and ok for people who want new music. (I've tried match..its even worse than AM)

Spotify can't upload my music to the cloud (I have a large collection with a lot of obscure music) and I can't organize/search by genre. It has good recommendations. Its really bad for people who have large, organized music collections and great for people who want new music..but I can't buy the songs, organize the new ones how I want, or add them into my main collection.

So I've given up on all the cloud services and am just going to use files. I can spend $120 a year on real music I own. I would love for a cloud service to work for me, or to just not care enough to be able to use one.

Hopefully this saves someone else with a large music collection a lot of hassle.","['Interesting perspective. Sounds like there is a gap in the market for a cloud storage music player, similar to what Google Play Music used to do.\n\nAM is working well for me because I can add my music to it like Game Soundtracks. That said, 90% of my library is now Apple Music.

It’s pretty easy to spot any changes by using iTunes. Add a column in the song view for iCloud Status and sort by that. Anything grayed out is no longer available (or no longer available in its current incarnation) but you can use your phone or tablet to re-add and rate the content. I do it about once a month.\n\nApple Music is really the only one that lets you upload a large library and have it integrate with your streaming library. Deezer lets you upload less but playlists are limited to 2k songs, Spotify doesn’t have an upload service, and Google Play Music is being phased out. Supposedly, YouTube Music is going to gain Google Music’s upload feature but Google has been dragging their heels with updates.', ""That's interesting. Never noticed my own personal files being altered.\n\nI certainly agree with you though.  Apple and Spotify suck.

iCloud Music Library is a disaster,"So far, the ONLY way I've been able to make Apple Music work without having the metadata for the songs in my iTunes library altered or deleted is to only use iCloud Music Library it on my Mac. 

iCloud Music Library seems determined to delete my loves and/or song ratings.  And iCML seems to always prioritize the info it has in the cloud over the info in my iTunes library even when my iTunes library is more current.  I change ratings in iTunes.  iCML deletes them.

I have three devices: A Mac, which is where I listen to music 95% of the time, plus an iPhone and an iPad.  The only way I've been able to use Apple Music without having my Mac's iTunes library garbled is to turn off iCML on my iPhone and my iPad.  For those, I sync files the old fashioned way - which means I can't sync Apple Music downloads to my iPhone or iPad... but each time I've tried turning on iCloud Music Library for more than one device, it has wreaked havoc on my library. Song ratings get deleted. Loves get deleted. Album ratings get added. Comments get deleted.
I think most people experience these problems but don't notice. I suspect I've experienced far more problems with iCML that I haven't noticed.

When I first started noticing changes being made to my library, I created a new smart playlist called CHECK RATINGS with two simple rules: Show all songs whose rating is greater than 0 stars and loved is false. Show all songs whose rating is 0 and loved is true. Then, I highlighted every song in my entire library rated 1 star or higher and I set them all to loved. I use applescripts triggered by hotkeys to rate songs (command+0 through command+5) so I altered the applescript to also love any song I'm rating 1 star or higher, and unlove any song I rate at 0 stars.

Once I set that up, it became easy to see if iCML was deleting either my ratings or my loves. I have no idea why, but to the best of my knowledge, it always seems to delete one but not the other (more often than not, it's the rating that gets deleted by iCML).

Once I set that up, something started to become obvious: if I'd use Apple's music app on my iPhone or iPad, iCloud Music Library would do wacky things to the iTunes library on my Mac EVEN IF I DIDN'T CHANGE ANY RATINGS OR LOVES ON MY iPHONE OR iPAD.

For example: I went a few months without using my iPad for listening to music. Yesterday, I became curious to see if iCML was turned on on my iPad. It was. I opened the music app, and sure enough, there was my whole library, being streamed by iCML. Afterward, when I connected my iPad to my Mac to charge it... ratings started being deleted from songs on my Mac. I clicked the CHECK RATINGS playlist and watched it happen. That playlist should be empty. Instead, it had 30 songs. Then 35, then 50+, then 100+... 200+... 500+... I think it eventually ended up being 1544 songs, all of whose ratings were deleted by iCloud Music Library... and all I did was open and glance through the music app on my iPad (I didn't even play anything!). So, I opened and then closed the music app on my iPad, and the next time I synced my iPad... chaos on my Mac's iTunes library.

iCloud Music Library is a disaster. I think most people haven't noticed because most people don't notice what's happening to their libraries.  And who can blame them?  It's not easy to keep track of changes to songs when you've got tens of thousands of them.

Apple Music needs the option to download music without using iCloud Music Library, even if that means not being able to sync Apple Music songs across devices.  Downloading music from Apple Music is the only reason I still have iCML turned on on my Mac.  It's off on my other devices, and if it keeps creating havoc, I'm going to have to turn it off on my Mac too.  At that point, there's no sense in paying $10 a month for Apple Music.

iHate iCloud Music Library.  It's a disaster.

Apple needs to treat a user's library as being sacred.  They should never change a user's ratings, loves or any other metadata without a user's consent **or intent.**","[""They're slowly making strives to improve Apple Music.

"""You do not have permission to access this resource"" And other weirdness","Hello all, I never knew there was a subreddit all about AM until this morning, cool! (although it seems obvious there should be). 

Anyways, I got into apple music on my iphone 6 when Dre's Compton came out, because I was dying to hear it and figured what the hell, free 3 months, cool! I went through the setup and all was well. I played Compton to death (and loved it), and then went on checking out other artists at will through AM. 

Anyways, it wasn't long before I ran into issues. I would go to play something and after a couple seconds of silence receive a pop-up message saying ""You do not have the permission required to access this resource."" Then AM would continue trying different songs on whichever album it was from until one worked. Strangely enough, 1 - 3 songs on any given album would usually be able to play reliably, while the rest would give me this message. This would happen on new albums as well as ones I had played without issue before, seemingly at random. 

Another weird quirk was that it would seem to have some kind of 'muscle memory' for songs I had listened to several times. Like, if I threw on an album, listened all the way through, then replayed tracks 3,4 and 7 a whole bunch because I really liked them, the next day I might open up the same album on AM and find that I can now ONLY listen to 3,4,7, and the rest present this message. I just don't understand.

As I'm typing this I have found that if I turn off my wifi connection I can get around *some* songs that have this problem. While others still have no issue, wifi or not. And some always display the message no matter what and seem totally out of reach.

One other small but annoying hangup I have experienced is that AM will just seem to pause itself out of nowhere. I will realize music has stopped and think that my headphones pulled out, or that it had a laggy moment and was buffering or something, but nope, I just have to press play again and we're good...not that big of an issue when I'm just walking around or something, but when I'm in the shower with music on, or otherwise have the phone out of arms reach playing off of some speakers, this can be quite frustrating.

Wtf, Apple Music? I had only intended to play out the free trial of this service originally, but after a couple weeks of pleasant streaming and exploring artists that piqued my curiosity, I was seriously considering continuing my subscription and paying for it.

Was this thing beta tested?,"If yes, how the hell did this many atrocious bugs, not to mention awful design choices, make it through? I'm reading horror stories about peoples' entire local libraries being hashed to pieces by Apple Music trying to match them to stuff in its collection. iTunes 12.2 has inexplicably and irreversibly lost its ability to push library changes to the cloud (and thus to my phone) and now completely reverts changes I make (ratings, playlists, etc.) seconds after I make them. Random songs are greyed out and unplayable because iTunes thinks I didn't buy them even though I just added them half an hour ago.

Apple Music's Favorites Mix is pretty horrible,"EDIT: Title should be New Music Mix not Favorites Mix.

Hello!

So I thought today that I should check out what does Apple Music's New Music Mix have for me and I was pretty disappointed to say the least.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jwvyyzto6sk31.jpg

From 21 songs:

3 songs from Dino Skatepark

3 songs from Tonio Blu

3 songs from Damfmastermind

&#x200B;

They're pretty far from my taste and what I've been listening to.

EDIT: The issue here is not only bad recommendations but that the 3 songs from those same artists are even from the same album.","['The good news is, through curation (loving/disliking) your mixes will get better over time. One thing that immensely helped my curation was making a Smart playlist of my ""loved"" songs - I\'m so much more inclined to click that heart if I have a playlist where I can view and listen to every song I have loved. This is something that comes standard with most other streaming services, shame that you need iTunes for it to work on Apple Music.\n\nThe bad news is that Apple releases these lackluster playlists only on a weekly basis - so after an afternoon of listening to your favorites/chill/new music playlist, and after skipping and disliking a lot of songs, you have to wait 7 days for the next playlist to show up. At which point you just lose interest because you know it\'ll probably a disappointment anyways.\n\nI wish Apple would switch to daily mixes (like Spotify has) - even if they are garbage at first, I think after a week of liking/disliking that Apple would have a much better understanding of one\'s tastes...and would be far better at curating the ""For You"" page subsequently. \n\nHonestly I rarely listen to these mixes anymore because they just aren\'t that interesting to me. I find the personal radio station is much better (because it mixes both discovery and your favorite tracks into one endless radio station).

Friends- The friends feature has really improved and there’s nothing to complain about there. A cool thing that can be added, make a playlist and give permission to one of/ to all of your friends to edit and add to a playlist!

"Does anyone else miss the old ""For You"" layout?","While the new layout gives more pointed recommendations, I feel like it is missing the visual pizazz that the old ""For You"" section had. This new layout is just a list of genres that I listen to often - albeit, it is giving me good recommendations within those genres - but *visually* there is no variation on the page. Before, we would get big headline sized recommendations for Saturday or Friday night playlists, along with other playlists Apple thought we would most like to hear that day. This visual spark is completely missing in the new iteration - the new style is just drab. And compare it to the new ""Browse"" tab - it is seemingly a completely different interface. ""Browse"" is inviting, colorful, there are big pictures and icons to pull you into listening to the music (similar to the old ""For You"" section).

One more thing: I wish that we had our own personal radio station (like YouTube Music has) that would continually play music we like and music Apple thinks we would want to hear. I would just love a button on the top of the ""For You"" page that plays a continuous station of my favorite music and discoverable music.

A Very Negative Experience With Apple Music,"Hi all. I wanted to share an incredibly negative experience I am having with Apple and possibly entertain some advice on any avenues of action I might be able to take. 

Story goes:

I had to get a new debit card, and I was trying to update my billing info in my Apple Music app. The app asked for 2 Factor authentication using a phone number ending in 03. I've never had a phone number ending in 03 in my life, so it seemed as though my account may have been compromised. 

I called customer service to try to get access to my account back. Apparently, there is literally no way for me to get access to my account without access to this phone number. I explained that this phone number was clearly either non-existent or in somebody else's possession, but they said there was no other way to verify my identity. I didn't believe them, so I spent nearly an hour on the phone with managers, technical support, etc. It just seemed so archaic and non-sensical that a phone number would be the only possible way to verify an account.

Well, it turns out that it is exactly that non-sensical over at Apple. There's literally nothing they are either able or willing to do. 

So, once I had accepted that the account was gone forever, I asked for my purchased music as a download, and I would just make a new account. They said without access to the account that I could not access that music. 

This was where I became very upset. It seems as though Apple is holding my property against my will. I told them there were 2 outcomes that would be acceptable to me:  
1) Provide me with downloadable links to all my purchased music.  
2) Issue me a full refund for all my purchased music.   
They said neither was possible. I pleaded, I chastised them, I tried everything, but they wouldn't budge.   
Now I feel as though I shouldn't roll over and let them keep my property against my will. I sent their legal department an email requesting either my property or a refund within 72 hours time. If I don't receive either, I currently plan to file a small claims suit against them. I have plenty of PTO left this year, and its a matter of principle for me now.   


Is there anything else I can do?","[""Why didn't you have 2FA already enabled on your account? If you didn't take the necessary precautions to secure your account, then the blame starts with you."", 'It’s not your property. You bought a license to the music not the actual music like if you were to buy physical media. Apple is within their rights to rescind that license at their discretion. It’s in the TOS you and everyone else who uses iTunes agreed to.  You lose access to your account you lose the music licenses associated with it\n\nEdit: this is the case with anything “purchased” digitally', 'It’s not your property though. Read the TOS. You pay to have access to it. Say the artist took all their music off Apple. You too would lose the music. At least that’s been my experience. \n\nApple Music sound quality is horrible anyway.

Words cannot express the degree to which I despise Apple Music right now...,"After years of resistance I finally decided to sign up and give it a try a couple of weeks ago.

But then.... I went to my computer.... a weird audio recording of a speech came up while on shuffle.... I needed to delete it.... and there right before my eyes.......

My *highly*curated library has been **RUINED**! Thousand upon thousands of tracks have had tags changed. Genre tags have been altered or completely stripped away, composers are gone or changed, titles have been changed (I like to put “X - Single [19xx] after appropriate songs or - CD/LP after albums if I had two copies from different sources.) It’s gone. Stripped away. Thousands upon thousands of tracks have been altered. Hundreds of hours work; destroyed. I have spent years fine tuning my library, I wasn’t done, I could never be done because there is always more music to be heard.

Awful start to Apple Music,"I recently decided to test out Apple Music after being with Spotify for almost 4 years because I was really wanting the ability to go on runs with just my AirPods and Apple Watch series 3 and leave the iPhone at home, which if I’m not mistaken, Apple Music is the only streaming service that allows that. After signing up I’ve run into so many problems I can’t see Apple Music being worth it in the long run

1.)  Music won’t sync between my iPhone and MacBook. After allowing the iCloud music library on all my devices my Mac still is unable to receive any of my playlists giving me an error message “genius results couldn’t be updated right now. The network connection was lost” even though the network connection is working fine for everything else

2.) Playlists on my phone won’t download. After importing one of my Spotify playlists I wanted to download it onto my phone but it won’t finish downloading. The download circle sits about 75% finished and that’s it while almost every song has a circle about 95% complete. 

3.) Downloading playlists onto my watch is extremely slow / not working. After almost 15 minutes not even one song has downloaded. If I can’t download songs onto my watch I don’t see the benefits of Apple Music over Spotify. 

Although I want to like Apple Music and fit it into my Apple ecosystem these initial problems plus other functionality features like the inability to organize playlists and an, in my opinion, less clean MacBook app than Spotify makes me want to go back to Spotify. 

If anyone’s experienced / experiencing these issues or why you use Apple Music over Spotify I’d love to hear from you.

Canceled Apple Music subscription before trial ends and lost access to Apple Music immediately,"Hi all,

I have a very bad experience with Apple Music trial subscription now. I just subcribed to Apple Music 3-month trial and to avoid getting charged towards the end of the trial period, I canceled the subscriptions hoping that I would continue to enjoy the 3-month trial period. To my astonishment I lost immediate access to Apple Music right after cancelation and after reaching out to Apple Support they said no to restore my unused trial period, that's is even after speaking to a Senior Apple Advisor named Gorna over the phone. I acted based on this thread on apple discussions - [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8277618](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8277618.) where it says ' If you cancel during your trial period, you'll continue to have access to the entire Apple Music catalog until the date that you would have been billed for the full price. ' I am quite surprised Gorna even advised me to create a new apple ID and try the free Apple Music on another apple device to enjoy the 3-month free trial, is she trying to tell me to exploit the loophole and enjoy Apple Music for free forever?

Apple AirPods Top 5 Reasons To Buy Apples Wireless BlueTooth Headphones in 2017,,"[""For me, the Beats X headphones are simply better because they don't fall out. So if you're one of those weird people with an oddly shaped ear canal, it's a pretty miserable existence. The Beat X give you all the benefits of Apple AirPods with none of the headaches at a cheaper price point. Also, the Beats X in-ear buds block out a lot of sounds and give you an overall better listening experience. The AirPods allow a lot of background noise. So depending upon the environment that you're in and how you use your headphones that may be suited for your use case. It's all about how you use headphones for an office environment I would recommend the AirPods and for someone that is more active and moving around a lot the Beats X are better.""]",1,952.4872002313313,apple_music

* it is not showing about 99.99% of my library(only seven songs are coming through)

Have you checked out iTunes lately?,"Is it possibly better at discovering music than Music? I think it’s a little easier to navigate and it’s just more dynamic and interesting to browse. There’s a section that shows the new releases from artists in my library. 

The biggest difference, it seems, is that Music is pushing new music, popular artists, and helps people who don’t know much about music while iTunes is more like a generic record store where you can browse freely without a salesman pushing you in one direction.

If you haven't gotten a Favorites Mix – this could be why,"I was looking at my songs tab in AM and noticed my play count list was low for nearly a month's worth of listening (I switched from Spotify a month ago). The play count didn't add up to me, and it was probably due to the fact that I'm one of those people that skip songs halfway through songs (even though I enjoy what I'm listening to).   


**Apple Music isn't counting skipped songs as plays.**  


Apple Music only counts full track listens as a play count it seems. My concern is if this type of metric is preventing users from seeing a Favorites Mix, because you haven't registered enough plays to generate a mix.  


I start a track like ""Starboy"" from the Weeknd 100x, listen for 2/3 of the track but not finish it – does AM know that I really enjoy this song? If I listen to the track fully from start to finish, it should know I like it even more.

Things that are wrong with Apple Music,"I've been using Apple Music for 3ish years now. I quite like the ability to stream and especially music from wherever inside my Apple ecosystem.  
When I made the switch I had around 25.000 songs sitting around locally, however I couldn't help but notice some issues I couldn't get to work yet and it's been increasingly frustrating over the years.  

&nbsp;

a) Obviously Apple tries to match a music title with one in their database to push your music to the cloud, so they can avoid traffic. But this resulted in going from Explicit to Censored, which is extremely annoying. I tried a multitude of things but ""tell Apple Music"" to replace the Censored version with the Explicit one, integrating in my album.  
b) I have some custom music, which was uploaded successfully. However on iPhone when I download the song, it won't let me play it, giving me: ""The operation could not be completed, unknown error occurred (-12894)"". When I delete the song and stream it from the cloud it works for one playback but then the same error occurs. I tried renaming the song and reuploading it to Apple Music, thinking the 320kb/s version's corrupt, but the same error keeps on showing up.  

&nbsp;

It's extremely frustrating to migrate to a streaming service, expecting more flexibility which then ends up resulting in an equal amount of constraints. Is there anyone else experiencing similar issues, or has anyone found a viable workaround for the mentioned issues?","[""So to me it sounds like you started using Apple Music and iCloud Music Library when it first came out or fairly early on. Back then yes it would attempt to match titles and artists and albums. Definitely had the same issues as you with the explicit to clean. Short time after they actually changed how it matches, by now doing what's called a music fingerprint. Long story short it analyzes the songs and attempts matching that way. Haven't seen an explicit to clean issue since. Only thing is you'd need to remove all the content from your iCloud library and get it all rematched and uploaded. \n\nFor your other issue, do you have any other device than your iPhone to test it on? Does it do the same thing there? Is your iPhone's software up to date?""]",3,171.4141099541331,apple_music

[Discussion] Song title censorship,"Is anyone else driven absolutely crazy by how Apple Music censors song titles, and how there's no option to turn this off?

In a practical sense, sometimes track titles are so asterisked out that I can't tell what they are saying. Also, it messes up all of my metadata with third party services like Last.FM.

Aside from that, It's just prudish and infantilizing. It's weird to censor song titles when the audio is not censored. And they're very aggressive with the censorship... even things like ""ass"" and ""damn"" are sometimes censored. My elementary school was less aggressive with censorship than Apple is...

Spotify and Tidal don't do this. iTunes *does* allow you to modify the track metadata (at least on Mac/PC), but *damn* it's obnoxious!",['I’m pretty sure all this data comes from the record labels.

So...AM = my personal mp3s go *poof* ?,"I’m a bit of a noob with Apple Music. Still on the free three month trial, actually. I just activated the function that merges the music on my phone with music on my MacBook through the iCloud music library.

From what I can tell, it does this:

- iCloud scans my entire music library on my Mac and uploads all songs and playlists to my iCloud music library.

- Apple Music attempts to match any songs in my playlists that are available on iTunes and makes them playable on my iPhone.

The thing is, if any songs don’t match (I.e. aren’t available on iTunes) they are not playable on my iPhone. Obviously, a lot of my *personal* music and MP3s like a recording of my kid playing ukulele, or a friend’s recorded DJ set will not be available on iTunes. I can see items like this listed and greyed-out in my phone’s playlists but I’m not able to play them, and I can’t figure out a way to sync them to my phone without also turning off iCloud music library merging.

Is there anyway this can be done?  Am I missing something here, like a function that makes this possible?

Apple Match Question,"Good Morning,

I am looking at Apple Match as a way to stream all of my music, but I have one sort of odd question before I purchase it.

On my new computer, if I load that up it brings up a list of songs that was identical to my music library. These will not play however as the audio files are absent. If I purchase Apple Match, will it match these songs or will I end up with zero?

Apple music behaving quite strange (artwork problems among other things),"Ey bbygurls, lemme holla atchu.
First post here. 
Anyway, been loving Apple Music since I first got it, the UI is way more attractive than Spotify, and I do hear a slight difference in sound quality as well (for the better). 
But anyway, I have noticed that sometimes when I add an album into my library, it sometimes skips over songs, and also I had this weird thing where my library completely disappeared when I tried to view an object from the US iTunes Store (to add: i'm not from the US, nor do I live there). and after that it took a couple of hours, then it was back. BUT, a lot of the artwork has disappeared, and even if I delete and re-add them I still don't have the artwork in my library/attached to the music file. I think a nice artwork really heightens the experience of listening to an album, so this is completely bumming me out. Sometimes it seems like the artwork is on iTunes but not in my phone as well. 
I am otherwise pleased with the service overall and it has made me go from sort of being all ""nah I don't wanna stream, I want to have it on my phone as mp3's"". to actually feeling like I can build a library of music and have so much music at hand ALL THE TIME. So that's cool. 
Spotify > Apple Music when it comes to playlists, but if Apple starts bettering themselves on that matter then i for sure am cancelling my spotify subscription instead of having both. 

But yeah, how can I make sure that I actually get the artwork? Having that empty space just drives me nuts. Also one other thing. I have an entire library of my own stuff in iTunes as well, but just ONCE i clicked on a song when I had accidentally unplugged my ext. harddrive, and now all the songs have the exclamation marks before the song title. Is there anyway to actually just make it find those files again, ALL OF THEM at the same time, and also without having to reupload all to the iCloud music library?","['You have to get into Get Info on the album and manually add the artwork there, then it should propagate to your device.

I have a windows 7 PC, an iPhone6, and an iPad air 2.

I really really want to enjoy using Apple Music,"But right now I can't. It feels like a half assed attempt by Apple honestly. Spotify beats it in almost anything. From things as basic as not even warning you when you're adding a duplicate song to a playlist up to things like not really having competition with Discover Weekly and Release Radar. I wish I could justify subscribing to AM since it's the same price as Spotify but the jarring user experience makes it not worth it. The Windows and Mac versions of iTunes are clunky and annoying to use and it doesn't even have Handoff integration - Spotify Connect can control devices across the world and yet iTunes and Apple Music can't control devices in the same room! It feels like Apple really doesn't put as much effort in to things as they should. iCloud.com hasn't seen an update in years either - surely that would be the perfect place for an Apple Music web player!

Why I use Apple Music over Spotify,"Simply this: Spotify never works over my data plan. The gimmicks and UI are cool and all that, but it amounts to almost nothing when one app is too bloated to load music over data. Is that a knock on T-Mobile or Spotify? It doesn't matter, because the fact is that if Spotify can't take into account that MOST people have constricted data plans they're gonna keep losing customers to other streaming services.

I mean sure downloaded music is cool but not everybody has huge storage on their phones. Hell, I was using a cheap phone earlier this year IN 2018 that came with 4 gb of storage. You can bet the data wasn't fast either. These are the kinds of phones that developing markets are using, and when Spotify crams a bunch of features into your app that restrict me from simply LISTENING TO MY MUSIC then why bother using Spotify in the first place.

Sure, Apple Music may be streamlined, but at least Apple understands that not everybody NEEDS Genius live lyric displays or AI running behind every goddamn song at the expense of data connection.","['Haha this libtard uses t-mobile, stone him']",1,330.9486817144575,apple_music

My First Album is in Apple Music! It’s an Ambient Record about aliens and conspiracy.

My favorite ambient music creates an expansive sense of place and takes the listener on a journey through it, while the tracks on this album simply fade out after around three minutes without ever really going anywhere. For example, the sonic palette of the opening track, ""Carriers of Life,"" reminds me strongly of the intro to Robert Rich & Lustmord\'s ""Elemental Trigger,"" but where that track gradually shifts through a series of tones and moods from pastoral to ominous and back again, ""Carriers of Life"" has shown all its cards within the first minute and fails to surprise thereafter. The rest of the tracks on here suffer from this as well; they simply feel like they\'re treading water and counting down the seconds, which isn\'t something I should be thinking about songs this short.\n\nMy favorite part of the album was the back-to-back of ""Signals"" and ""Fallen,"" particularly the way the drum beat that periodically fades in for a few seconds in ""Signals"" sounds like a shaky, distorted version of the one on ""Fallen,"" as though it\'s an interstellar radio broadcast struggling to come through clearly until it finally does. I\'m not sure if this was intentional, but if so, I can\'t help but feel that these two tracks might have been more effective as two movements of a single, flowing work.\n\nUltimately, I wasn\'t too impressed with this record and probably won\'t come back to it as a whole, although ""Fallen"" might get a spin now and then.

I frequently need to restart the app to resolve the issue.  But even then sometimes that doesn't work.  For hours yesterday I just got a blank page trying to access my new music mix.

No problems on my iPhone apple music app though.

iTunes has never been fully perfect.  And in the past the random blips, freezes, and glitches have been infrequent and tolerable.  But it really is now reaching a boiling point of true frustration and ineptitude.

I must vent.","['iTunes on PC is **horrible**. I always thought it was because I had an old computer. It takes forever to load up a section like Movies or TV, takes forever to startup, even backing up my phone is a chore. \n\nBut I’m able to play some memory intensive games on my computer and Plex converts files fast. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where I intentionally avoid using iTunes and try to do everything via my phone. \n\niTunes has gotten worse and worse with each update for Windows. It’s a bloated mess. It’s not just you. ', 'Even on a home-built monster gaming machine, iTunes still bogs down.\n\nIt’s terrible on Windows.   Just keeps getting slower with each update.   Terrible Windows support from Apple.   ', 'iTunes on Windows is terrible, just as described. Sadly, it is the only way to do things with Apple Music, as the iPhone functionality is nowhere near it.\nManaging the library works fine, but the Browse and For You tabs are buggy as hell and getting worse every day. WTF Apple? Is it really that hard to embed a browser inside a windows application?', 'I always read these complaints, but iTunes has always worked great on my 2011 iMac. ', 'One tip I can offer to significantly improve iTunes speed is to not have local music. I used to have an external hard drive with all my music attached to my PC, and I uploaded all those tracks to Apple Music\'s iCloud. I had to uninstall iTunes for some reason, and, after I reinstalled it, I opted not to connect my hard drive since all my music was already listed in iTunes via iCloud. The difference in performance is staggering. My iTunes rarely freezes or skips now, and I have a pretty massive library (nearly 100k tracks). \n\nIf you have Apple Music, I recommend uploading all your music and then remove the local copies from iTunes (basically all your tracks will have that ""cloud"" symbol next to them). You should see improvement afterwards. ', 'I really like Apple Products, I love my iPhone and iPad so naturally I switched to Apple Music from Spotify when it released. It’s also cheaper than spotify and the music recommendations are better in my opinion.\n\nHowever I just can’t stand the windows desktop program. It feels really old compared to Spotify. It doesn’t matter how powerful your pc is, it’s always just so slow. And it’s really fustrating because I have a quite new and powerful pc.\nAlso you can’t control the desktop app from your phone and there’s no Discord integration.\n\nI really hope Apple will update it soon.', 'iTunes will be retired, soon', 'Yes! I had the same problem yesterdayy I couldn’t load any other page than “For You”. Buttons were not working.', 'I have this problem too since first version of High Sierra', 'On Windows 10, I’ve had problems such as AM’s search function where the album art just stops loading no matter the connection. It happens about every 4th search or so. Incredibly annoying, because it doesn’t get fixed unless you restart the app.\n\nAlso, for some reason, when I installed a bluetooth driver for my PC, iTunes would refuse to open unless I ran it as administrator.\n\nIt’s also slow on my late-2011 MacBook Pro, but it’s somewhat more stable. I have a feeling that Apple is just neglecting it and only updates it to add new devices (homepod, etc)', 'The latest version is horrible on my MacBook Pro.

I can’t explain why... nor am I going to pretend to fully understand the complexity of it... but once I deleted “chrome” everything went back to normal.

“You should have kept your CDs”,"Advice from Apple Music “Support” when trying to find out if they can get back my entire deleted music library when they cancelled my subscription when changing countries.

You still have whatever ownership you had before--what you don't have is the ability to download these songs from Apple (unless you purchased them in the iTunes store, but I am not certain about country restrictions there since they may be subject to country-specific label licensing agreements). Neither Apple Music nor iTunes Match are backup services; the upload and stream-anywhere functionality is only a convenience that's part of the overall service.

Help me pals 🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️,"Whatsup reader of this post,

I used Apple Music for 2 years only because it looks really nice (I know weird reason). However I am really thinking about switching to Spotify because of one main reason. I just don’t understand why the fuck Apple Music has no sort feature for playlists. You can not sort a playlist by “old” or “new”. I have got a playlist with like 500 songs and it sucks to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the playlist just to click on my newest song. Even than it plays in the inverted order the songs were added. This means that if I listen to the newest added song, after it the playlist “ends” and Apple Music will play the very first song of the playlist which is the oldest added song. This is really annoying and I cannot stand this anymore. I even created a workflow/shortcut where you can select a playlist and then it will copy all the songs into a new playlist in inverted order. Thus I can start with the newest added song and the next song will be the second newest song... . But that’s really annoying too and is not a good solution. I looked up everything on the internet, but no one is aware of this problem or doesn’t care (?🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️?). Shouldn’t something like this be a basic feature of a streaming platform?!

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just not loving it so far. Some of this just has to do with making the transition, but here's what I don't like. 

&#x200B;

1) there's not an easy way to get from a track to its parent album or artist (that I'm aware of). On spotify it's just 2 clicks. 

2) there's not an easy way (that I know of) to browse through the music I've most recently listen to. I tend to fixate on a handful of albums at a time, so Spotify's 'recently listened' window was clutch. 

3) subjective (I understand this is very anecdotal), Spotify is missing some music that I like! Just for example, the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack is only like half available on AM (mostly missing classical or some weird European tracks), whereas it's totally available on Spotify. That's just one example so I get that it's kind of dumb, AM actually has more tracks than Spotify I understand. Similarly, it was really hard to find a recording by classical composer David Lang that I love. Makes me wonder if AM is worse for classical music??

&#x200B;

Please help convince me to love AM haha. Lots of people enjoy the program. Maybe it just takes some time to make the transition.","['1) On the Now Playing screen, press the pink text under the song name then choose Go to Artist/Album. \n\n2) The Recently Played section on the For You tab might be your best bet. \n\n3) Can’t really help you too much here.', 'Technically Spotify doesn’t have the full CMBYN soundtrack either.

It only works after adding the album to your library and can take minutes or days to happen.\n\nAs a workaround I would suggest adding one of the CMBYN Shared Playlists instead of the actual album. For example - [Call Me By Your Name ](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/playlist/call-me-by-your-name/pl.u-yZyVlDrFdDyoE2).\n\nAlternatively you can upload any missing music to your iCloud Music Library via a computer running iTunes.', ""Regarding to item #3, Spotify works a bit different when it comes to completing albums with unavailable tracks.

Apple music = disappointing vs. Spotify,"I realise that people on here may feel differently or not really care about these features that form the basis of my opinion here, and I welcome that! Please have a civilised discussion on reasons that you may agree/disagree below and please let us know why you like either or another music platform and why!

&#x200B;

So let me begin by saying that I am an Apple music subscriber and was previously a Spotify subscriber before this. I moved to AM when buying an Apple Watch due to the lack of a Spotify Watch app or ability to play music through this device. However, now Spotify is available on the Apple Watch and not only that, provides a better service that Apple Music is, here's why.

&#x200B;

Apple lives and dies by the mantra that when great solutions work best when software and hardware are seamlessly cooperating, creating experiences that the user need not work hard to wield or enjoy. However, with the current Apple Music experience, this is not the case. If like me you own more than one Apple product, then you're probably familiar with this issue. Although if you do not have more than one Apple device then you're probably confused as to what I am referring to, so I will try to explain to the best of my ability. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I have an iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and believe me that I love each device, in its own way, the software and hardware of each work seamlessly. The issue arises when you try to take this experience from one device to another, sure there are ways to enjoy music on all devices but continuing the experience to another of the devices is difficult and ruin the overall experience.

&#x200B;

For example, say that you are listening to a great playlist and you're enjoying this on your iPad, this may be through ear or headphones either plugged in or wirelessly connected. Let us say that you then need to go on the move and you take your iPhone and Apple watch with you. In the car, both your iPhone and Apple Watch can connect via Bluetooth. 

You use your phone and want to continue listening to the same playlist that you were enjoying on your iPad however the music does not continue seamlessly. Instead, you need to locate and either begin the playlist again or trawl through the list to find the song that you were previously enjoying. 

Finally, you go running, something that the Apple Watch is known for and the exercise is tracked well! Unfortunately, you have to take another 10 minutes to set which song you got up to in the playlist and switch your ear/headphones to the Apple Watch, because once more the listening session is not seamlessly continued on the other device. 

You're forced to navigate the confusing multitude of music-related apps on the watch (I believe there are about 3/4) and switch from acting as a remote to the phone to the device playing your playlist. All not easy on a device with a user interface not much bigger than a couple of your fingernails!

&#x200B;

Don't get me started with the iTunes experience on Windows, which has always been gimped when compared to running on Mac.

&#x200B;

When you compare this to the experience on Spotify, whatever you are listening to, on WHATEVER device, you can control and continue listening to on all devices. You can pause, skip and choose another track using your watch while you are listening on your PC. 

Say you need to again go on the move, go into another room, you can continue on your iPad. You need to go running? You can continue on your phone in the car and then the watch, easily switching seamlessly! Without at any time having to trawl through menus or locate tracks, because it is a unified experience compared to the compartmentalised approach that Apple has taken.

&#x200B;

TL:DR Apple's approach to their Music streaming service is not seamless and leads to a bad UX. When compared to Spotify, their service seems archaic and convoluted.

&#x200B;

Do you think that Apple will improve its streaming service to make it a true competitor? Do you think it's already a better service than the competition? Do you use another service altogether?

Social jukebox app for Apple Music - mubo - Would love your feedback!,"I'd like to introduce to you mubo, a social jukebox app that lets you control the music together with your friends. But mubo is not a simple jukebox app where you can just up and down vote songs. There is so much more we developed to bring you and your friends a great music experience for your next party :)

**App Features Overview:**

* Host a Musicbox, a music player which allows your friends to vote songs
* Voting: The song with the most votes is played next
* Allow guests to add songs
* Cooldown System (You decide how often your guests receive new votes)
* Set Connection Range: Your guests have to be in this range to connect to your Musicbox
* Pin protection for private Musicbox
* Ghost Mode, Musicbox is invisible and friends connect via QR-Code
* Set a Welcome Message for every guest that connects to your Musicbox
* One playlist for different music sources (Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Fanburst)
* Philips Hue support

For details check our [Website](https://www.mubo-app.com)If you like to try the App you can get it here - [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/musicbox-mubo/id1089676976?ls=1&mt=8) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mubo.musicbox)

What do you think? Do you have any additional ideas for mubo? We would love your feedback!

Apple Music makes my iPhone un-usable to the point where Apple was going to replace it. Anyone else?,"Hi,

I've been having some strange issues with my iPhone freezing and settings app not opening can't load settings etc. I decided to contact Apple and see what was wrong.

Looking for followers and new people to follow,"I am quite frustrated with the unfriendliness of discovery in Apple Music. I would like to be able to do searches of users that have certain things, but Apple Music only allows me to search for usernames or be happy with the suggestions it gives which are 100% useless.

&#x200B;

Apple should allow user searches with some filtering such as:

* Has more than n public playlists
* Likes alternative and dislikes rap
* Has more than n followers
* Etc.

Until something like this is available, we are all trying to find alternative ways to connect. Hopefully this will hit some people with similar tastes to mine and allow us to follow each other.

Replacing all old mp3 music (I owned) with Apple Music,"My library is half old OWNED music, and new Apple Music music.  Is there an easy/fast way to replace all my old music with Apple Music branded songs?  Since it's 2018, I feel like I can finally rid myself of old mp3 files.  I could manually delete, and re-download each artist's discography but it seems tedious.

EDIT: I know that if Apple Music recognizes an file, it will brand it as Apple Music (allowing for it to be streamed).  I'm talking about files that Apple Music apparently doesn't recognize.  I guess I answered my own question?  I'll have to do it the hard way?","['iTunes Match is your best bet. It’s like £15 a year and it will store all the tracks you own in the cloud, DRM free.

Much safer if you ever decide to leave Apple Music. ', 'Uhm, I have never purchased music through iTunes but I assume all of your music belongs to your library. Maybe you could try the following workaround: use an app like Songshift to move all your library from Apple Music to Spotify, then delete all your library and finally move it back from Spotify to Apple Music. Of course, some tracks will be lost in the process so you would have to do some manual work, also if you have more than 10000 songs Spotify won’t import any more ones.', 'Responding to your edit.

Opinion: Spotify Is Better than Apple Music (x-post from r/Apple),"***obviously this is a TOTALLY biased, anecdotal, unscientific experiment. I love Spotify. There. I said it.***

So with the announcement of the HomePod and the speculation/potential that it will only support Apple Music, I thought I'd do a real world, very un-scientifitc comparison between Spotify's and Apple Music's song recommendations. 

This originally began after searching for one of the songs used during the keynote that I liked called ""Feel It Still"" (this song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR5ODc5Wbbo)), and then I figured I might as well do some other songs/genres while I'm at it. I did these tests by going to the selected ""test song,"" and then starting a station from it on both Spotify and AM (""Go to Radio"" and ""Create Station,"" respectively). I then wrote down the 5 next songs each platform suggested after starting a radio station based upon that song in order to see which platform suggests what songs based off the ""test"" song. I tried to include a wide range of musical types, with most of them being released relatively recently.

So there it is. What do you think? Which platform did the best? 

**My Opinion:**
Spotify blew AM out of the water in 3 main categories:


1. Song relevance (defined as = similarity to test song, released around the same time as the test song)
2. Song tempo (defined as = pairing upbeat songs with other upbeat songs & vice versa)
3. New song recommendations (defined as = frequency in which lesser-known songs were selected)

**Song Relevance:**

I feel that Spotify did a much better job at balancing new, fresh recommendations with ""oldies but goodies,"" while AM relied much too heavily on the popular, ""easy pick"" songs in order to compile a good playlists, with no regard to release date. Spotify's choices had plenty of new artists, but retained relevance and overall similar feel. Also, if I selected a newer song on Spotify, it tended to only select newer songs to pair with the test song in most cases, which is ideal when you want to listen to the newest stuff and ""set it and forget it.""  Meanwhile, 

**New song recommendations:**

AM had a tendency to select widely-known, already-popular songs that didn't quite fit, as if it were scared to make the wrong choice by venturing out into the unknown and select a song that is lesser-known. Spotify was much more selective and specific in its selections, often not afraid to stray away from mainstream artists and songs and not afraid to suggest artists I'd never heard of. However, Spotify would still pick awesome, current songs and mix them well into the playlist, giving it a good balance. 

**Song tempo:**

I think the songs selected by Spotify just flowed better. Not only were they similar in style to the test song, but they also matched in energy level and overall feel - whereas AM would be able to keep to a similar genre, but would go from up-beat, energetic songs to slower, duller songs, and also completely random, almost completely different songs. 

*Conclusion:*

**Of course, this is all highly subjective, and I included the song titles and artists so that all of you can go check them all out yourselves and make your own conclusions** about which platform suggested better-fitting song recommendations. Some other shortfalls include the fact that both of these platforms' algorithms make suggestions based upon previous listening, so your mileage most likely will vary. Like I said, this is all anecdotal and opinionated, but thought it might shine a little light on the overall style of each of these platforms.

At least in AM, if you start a station based on a song, that song will always be the first on the station, but the rest will be about the same.

Why I like Apple Music more than Spotify,"Apple Music Library: Library, consisting of playlists, artists, albums, songs, downloaded, as well as my most recently added music. This is exactly what I want to see when opening music, and it’s what I use most often.

Spotify Library: That said most of these are similar in Spotify, but it’s not the main screen you see when opening the app. adding to the number of clicks between opening the app and playing my music is inherently inefficient.

Apple Music for you: Another amazing part of Apple Music that isn’t provided by Spotify. Has new music and recommended playlists that are pretty good. Then it shows me what my friends are listening to, which is by far the most useful. Then heavy rotation, Saturday albums, new releases, all things I want to see with music I want to hear.

Apple Music Browse: Same shit as Spotify, I literally never use it except for maybe sometimes listening to the playlists:

Spotify Browse: Podcasts, Charts, New Releases, Videos, Discover, Concerts, along with some of their recommended playlists and “Genres and Moods” so basically a whole bunch of options that I’m never going to click because it’s not MY MUSIC. Instead most of the time when I’m on this page it’s to find my library instead.

Radio: who the fuck listens to radio? I certainly don’t.

Apple Music Search: clean, simple, shows recent searches and trending searches. Big plus: can search for songs you don’t know the name to by searching up lyrics.

Spotify Search: no trending searches, and a big fucking white microphone on screen to speak to Spotify. And has these useless things called Spotify codes u can take a picture of.

Then listening to music: Apple Music: Easily go to album or artist that the song is playing from by touching where it’s displayed. Scroll down to see shuffle repeat settings. Lyrics can be shown or hidden, but best of all the default screen doesn’t show any of this, only when u scroll down. Downloading and adding to library is easy, organizing your up next is easy.

Spotify: all the settings are crammed into the three dots at the right. Shuffle and repeat are well placed, but this “queue” is the hardest thing to organize while listening to music on the phone. Also the atrocity that are lyrics. I don’t care about “behind the lyrics” all I want to see is are the lyrics themselves.
","['I agree except the For You is widely regarded as subpar by most. It’s absolutely trash for me. \n\nRadio, I listen to radio from artist the most.

When Apple Music Becomes Obsolete,It seems inevitable that Apple Music will one day become obsolete (as all music consumption methods do over time). What is the best way to preserve your music library and future proof it if you are an Apple Music user? Is the only option to purchase individual music elsewhere and back it up on an external hard drive? Or is none of this necessary and should I just assume that the Apple Music service will be around indefinitely?,"['If you believe, as I do, that music streaming services in some form or another will always be around then you really don\'t need to sweat it. There are a myriad of services already that will take your ""library"" and port it to and from AM, Spotify, etc. [https://freeyourmusic.com](https://freeyourmusic.com) for example... Your music is just a list of songs, anyways - if you have downloads they\'ll all stop working eventually if you unsubscribe or AM disappears suddenly, so there\'s nothing worthwhile to back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I personally buy vinyl of any album I consider good enough to want to own in a permanent fashion.', ""Great question. As all things Apple Music will come to an end eventually. The big question is if will be during our lifetimes.  Personally I'll start worrying when Apple Music subscription member count is on a sharp decline.  Currently I'm not taking any measures to have a shadow library because it would cost me too much time and money to buy and/or download every track I've added to my library from AM during the last few years.\n\nPS: If you want to leave a mark of your collection after you're gone, you shouldn't be (only) collecting DRM music in the first place."", 'These days I just use streaming services as sources to hear new music I might like so that I can buy them on iTunes or as a vinyl record later. I never believe that any companies or services would stay active forever so having a copy of songs digitally or physically gives me peace of mind. The only thing that I have collection entirely on Apple/iTunes are movies. With nearly 2,000 titles it’s just easier to go digital.', 'The only foolproof method of having permanent access to music is to buy it on CD, rip it to a lossless format, and back those files up on a couple of hard drives.  You can backup your Apple Music files all you want but, once that DRM becomes invalid, they won’t work anymore.\n\nThat being said, it’s going to be a while before it’s shutdown. The music services that did shutdown or switch over were either early ones (like Napster and Rhapsody) or they were failing (Groove Music). Google Play Music is migrating over to YouTube Music so it really isn’t being shutdown and Spotify has been around for 10 years. It survived a period when many analysts said it wouldn’t last.\n\nApple Music is only 3 years old but it is the fastest growing music subscription service and its integrated into every product Apple sells. I would have been worried had it not taken off but it’s hitting subscriber levels in 3 years that took Spotify twice as long to reach.  If Apple does rebrand Apple Music or come out with something else, odds are high that they will let users migrate their libraries over. Otherwise they will give users plenty of notice, enough for you to switch your library to something else.', ""I still buy CDs/Vinyl/Digital copies of everything I want.  That's the only way to do it."", 'Only way I see apple music going away is a total economic collapse in which case hand crank turntable and vinyl is your best option.', ""Simple: Buy the music you really love, don't buy the music you'd be OK losing access to.

Age old question seen a lot. Apple Music or Spotify?,"Hello fellow Apple Music redditors. I’m new to this reddit and just wanted to get some opinions here. I currently am subscribed to Spotify. However, with Verizon Apple Music is part of my plan thus being free for me. I’m just trying to way out the pros and cons to each service. For me I like how Spotify has music and podcasts in one app and it streams to my google home devices without issue. However again Apple Music is free in my case and I like how it’s integrated into IOS. Anyone here in the same boat I’m in that could give some insight or maybe provide more pros/cons? Thanks all","['I use Apple Music for the sole reason of not being able to download any single song or a subset of songs in Spotify', 'I just switched from Spotify to AM so I’ll chime in. I had Spotify since it launched and I have discovered a lot of great artists with it, but I decided to switch recently because I wanted to integrate my personal library with AM. So what I’m doing now is keeping the free version of Spotify, and when I find a playlist I like, I’ll import it into AM using SongShift.', 'I just switched to Apple as well.
