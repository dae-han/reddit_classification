Switching from Google Play Music - Questions,"In light of Google's recent news to end GPM and migrate to Youtube Music, I've decided to go back to my first streaming service, Apple Music. When it comes to this streaming service, I have some questions.

Thanks","['Yeah, you can have it all in the same playlist, but it won’t start there. It’ll start in your library, separated under artists and whatnot (the classic iTunes setup).

Today the same thing happened, but it took about 5 minutes and a home screen crash before it would play again. My phone is now running very warm. This is the 4th time this has happened today.

"""Create a Station"" - Apple Music Vs. Pandora Radio","Coming from Pandora to Apple Music, I am accustomed to creating a station from an artist or as it is called there, "" X Artist Radio.""

In Pandora you're able to customize this station by ""sprinkling an artist here, an artist there"" to guide such station to play more of your desired artists.  I do not see that excellent feature on Apple Music. Am I not looking in the right place?

I know about the ""love or dislike"" features to customize such station, but that's not really making my station any better as it keeps playing a lot of music I do not care for, as if it is not ""smart enough.""

In addition, is there a specific location for these stations created by me?  I only see them under ""Recently Played.""

I Found a Great Use for the History Feature,"I have a music Library that has become very large over the years (I won't age myself here, but let's just say: From before iTunes was around).

I tell siri to shuffle all my songs, I listen on my commute, and skip the songs I dislike (they will still be in history), and when I reach my destination, I remove the bad songs using history.

Why Isn't Apple Music Independent from iOS Build Up To Now?,"I think it was about iOS 11 when Apple allowed users to remove basic applications such as Apple Music, Notes, Calendar, etc.  And then users can re-download those apps from the App Store.  Now I'm wondering why older iOS versions can't download the latest Apple Music app from the App Store, while Android can do so at anytime they want.

Coming from Spotify: Struggling to adapt,"I've been a longtime Pandora and Spotify user. Recently I had the opportunity to grab one of those $75 for $100 PayPal iTunes deals. I thought 'why not' - it felt like a great opportunity to try out a year of Apple Music. I've previously tried (2) 3-month trials of AM -- neither of which got me hooked; I just kept going back to Spotify.

I have to admit, as hard as I try I've really been struggling to get used to Apple Music. I had hoped that choosing AM would eliminate my need for two platforms, but now that is proving not to be the case. My main tension point is how well Pandora and Spotify deliver new music discovery. I find the AM interface downright confusing and it takes me sometimes twice as long to find what I'm looking for. Why not simple thumbs up / down on stations? When I create a new station based off a track I like, the station never delivers the results I'm looking for. Therefore I'm stuck to using pre curated playlists which contain music that is way too similar.

Just wondering who else has gone through this and come out the other end. Any tips would be appreciated. (or commiseration is fine, too.) Cheers.","[""Apple Music radio is laughable for me. It's so bad.

Lost songs when moved countries,"Heya!   
TL;DR; at the end.

I was pretty excited when Apple announced the Apple Music, mainly because of the ""You can add your songs to it"" since, with Spotify, I always had trouble. So I changed subscriptions on day one.

Recently I changed countries and naturally, changed the region on my iPhone. But before that, I had to wait for the Apple Music subscription to end, and to my surprise, I've lost everything from the service, songs, albums, playlists, even musics that I uploaded.

Tried to contact apple support, and got an answer that almost made me throw my phone at the wall ""You should have made a backup before changing"". Took a deep breath, waited for the next day, went to work, and could get an XML with my library from the iTunes I used there. Imported it using my home PC, I was happy that my songs, playlists were back there... But all of it was unplayable and marked as being from another region.

Has anyone come across this problem?

How much does Apple Music vary in its algorithm depending on the iOS version? Ex: iOS 9 vs iOS 13,"I have an iPhone and iPad Pro both on iOS/iPadOS 13 but traded my old iPad Air for the first gen iPad Mini (she needed something faster). I have a Bluetooth speaker in my shower that I like to use but not particularly fond of switching songs with no ability to change playlist or radio station or even see the song name. I was considering mounting the iPad Mini in the shower since I can't think of many convenient uses for it otherwise. I's the slowest device I've ever used in my life so there's not much I'd use it for over the iPad Pro apart from carelessly using it near water. It's on iOS 9 so it can't be a HomeKit hub, it can barely download a fraction of the apps I use on my other devices, etc. Not surprisingly, Apple Music works fine.

Since I’m not in any rush, I was thinking of waiting for it to go on sale, but is that the sort of thing that happens on this platform? Are there ever ‘global sales’ where lots of songs get discounted, or is it dependent on A&A themselves deciding to discount the song (which will likely never happen)? Just wanting to get all the info before buying, thanks for any help :)","['I think you are confusing Apple Music with iTunes.\n\nApple Music is a streaming platform that allows you to add & listen to whatever Apple has to offer for Apple Music. The entirety of iTunes is not available on Apple Music, but a big chunk of it is, more than any other streaming service too IIRC. Just search up an artist, album, song, or even an emotion and play whatever you want from the search results. Add it to your library (for no additional cost) and listen whenever. All of this for $10 a month ($10 is the standard plan, there are family and student plans available as well).\n\niTunes is a storefront that Apple has run for almost 2 decades now and houses any and every song that artists list on it (which **everyone** pretty much lists their music on iTunes). There is no monthly fee, because you only pay for which music you like. You can pay about $10 on an entire album, about $2 on a single song from an album. But that’s pretty much it. It’s entirely up to you.\n\nThe difference between these two mostly is ownership. With Apple Music, you do not own the music in your library (that is from Apple Music). If an artists wished to retire and take their work with them, they could remove their discography from Apple Music and delist it from iTunes. If you didn’t purchase the music on iTunes and only added it from Apple Music. It’s gone. And can only be brought back by illegally obtaining it pretty much. If you purchased the music on iTunes, it would remain in your library, because it’s yours, you own it. This is why Apple Music songs are encrypted when downloaded and iTunes songs aren’t.\n\nEDIT: Regardless, music only “goes on sale” if the artist/their label decides to participate in some sort of price decrease. Music that is “on sale” will usually appear on iTunes’s home page underneath a category like “Hard Metal for $5” or “New releases $7.99 and under”, etc.', 'Apple Music is a subscription based service.

Personal Library upload to Apple Music,"First time Apple Music user. I've been exploring and the concept of downloading the music I listen to most or just saving the ones I don't listen often for stream sounds quite great to save up space on my Mac. I have a decent personal music library on  with almost 3.000 music files upload manually by me, all with my own ratings, lyrics, cover, etc.  Almost all of my music is in iTunes Plus format so most of them appear messed up on Apple Music, especially the files I have on my computer and not synced to my iPhone.

My question is if it's possible to ""move"" the music files (library) I have manually imported to Music app that are stored on my Macbook's hard drive to Apple Music without loose my ratings, play count, playlists, etc.? After they are uploaded to iCloud is it safe to remove them from my computer without loosing them on Music app/iPhone/Watch? My main objective is to find out if it's possible to use exclusively AM features and keep a library with just songs that do not exist in AM such as remixes, lives...

Many thanks in advance!","['> My question is if it\'s possible to ""move"" the music files (library) I have manually imported to Music app that are stored on my Macbook\'s hard drive to Apple Music without loose my ratings, play count, playlists, etc.?\n\nYes, all of the iTunes-related metadata (rating, play counts, etc.) will also be uploaded and synced across your device.\n\n> After they are uploaded to iCloud is it safe to remove them from my computer without loosing them on Music app/iPhone/Watch?\n\nYes, you can remove your local files on your Mac and then just stream the songs just like any other AM songs. When removing, just make sure you choose ""remove download"" (or something like that), not ""remove from library"" (as the name implies, this will remove the songs from your library, i.e. all of your devices).\n\nAlso, one thing to remember is that AM\'s matching feature is quite hit-or-miss. Your song maybe uploaded as is, but also maybe matched from AM\'s catalogue. If it got matched, that means when you stream that song from your other device it will streams from AM\'s catalogue (and that maybe different from your version), while on your Mac, as long as you didn\'t remove the song, it will play the local files first.\n\nAnd that\'s not the ""hit-or-miss"" part. In my experience, even some of my songs that got matched (and these songs (or rather the version of the songs) aren\'t available on AM), when I stream them, it plays my version. For example, my Beatles\' mono catalogue. While some of them do get matched and when streamed it plays the stereo version from AM, but most of them, even though it got matched, it plays the mono version (as if it got uploaded instead of matched).\n\nSo, before you turn on the iCloud library, I strongly suggest you to backup your library first.']",4,10.390547441365543,spotify

Any fixes for sluggish Music application on Catalina (Mac OS)?,"A few weeks ago, users were expressing frustration about the many bugs in the Apple Music application in the new version of MacOS. 

For me, the major problem has been huge lag times (at least 10 seconds) when searching for music \*and\* when trying to play music. After many years of everything ""just working"" on the various Apple applications, this application definitely does not ""just work."" I usually end up playing music through my phone instead. 

Can anyone recommend possible solutions? Would a clean installation of the OS solve this problem? Do I need to blow out the old music cache? Is there an estimated release date for a patch to the software? 

Thanks!","['I have a 12” 2018 MacBook with a core m3 and the Catalina update seemed to really speed up loading times for me, especially from a cold boot with FileVault. Music seems to work normally on my little machine. You can try running “Sudo periodic daily weekly monthly” in terminal to clean some caches. Otherwise as long as your library is in the cloud, go ahead and delete your iTunes folder entirely and it will redownload.', 'No idea it seems like a horrible app on my mac too (27"" iMac 2017).

I recently swapped spotify for apple music and have been liking it quite a lot. However, I see two minor things I wish would get fixed:

1. When in an artist’s page in your library, albums and singles show up all together which is pretty annoying, I wish we were able to separate them just like they are separated in an artist’s online page.

2. The fact that there is no way to sort your playlists manually (only by title, recently added, etc), which just doesn’t make sense to me.

Spotify has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"I switched over to Spotify last year after using Apple Music for a bit (I had used Spotify in 2016) because I do agree that the UI is better with Spotify. 

However. 


An hour before Jesus is King arrived, an album I have been waiting for for about a year now and stayed up most of last night for, Spotify locked me out of all my accounts without warning. 

I was furious and desperately wanted a number to call in that moment to get this issue fixed quick. There is no number. You have to EMAIL them. I emailed them yesterday and it took 24 hours for them to respond, and  just sent back another email earlier today. 

I am a paying customer. My bank account has the payment listed for this month (including today— I checked since it is the end of the month). 

But right now I am paying, as a broke ass college student, for NOTHING while I wait for their end to fix things.

My story of 'AM vs. Spotify' and why AM wins it for me,"Hi guys, wanted to share. so for a year or two, I've been a premium user on both services. Can definitely say that overall I probably used Spotify more, but never couldn't really leave AM. something in my head always drew me back to AM.

The thing is that I really love discovering new music (#spotify), but also, and not less important, I want to have a proper library with my loved albums and to be able to build a nice collection (#AM).

I just can't stand Spotify's UI and library anymore. I  get dizzy when I open the app, too much things going on, I always feel lost and not on top of my favorite music, either new discoveries or old loved ones. and boy, I really tried, I'm not a playlists person. Spotify is so playlist-centric, while AM is much more album-centric.

When iOS 13 came out, decided to commit to AM for a while. I deleted  all my library and started fresh. Since then I'm working on my library, adding my favorite albums, fixing/editing tags, making sure Genres are correct and unified, maintaining a ""Albums to check"" playlists, 'Loving' favorites songs within my saved albums, giving Star Ratings (only 5's for now) for my most loved songs, and of course, using the hell outta the Lyrics feature.

TLDR - decided to give up Spotify and its great discovery engine for MUCH better library management and to be able to build a proper collection.

It’s that I know why Spotify has this focus: self-interest. \n\nApple Music may have its kinks and issues, but you can tell by using the service that their core design principle is to just offer a good experience for people who love music. This is a moving target, but you can tell it’s what the design team is after. Offering a good experience. \n\nMeanwhile, Spotify really wants you to listen to playlists. Especially the ones they create. Why is that? Because they sell playlist placement to labels. You know those playlists the system automatically makes for users? If you’re a label, you can pay Spotify to feature your songs over other songs that could have been featured on those playlists. It’s a whole business for Spotify. \n\nAt first I thought “well, ok, I’m not against Spotify making money”. And of course I’m not. I don’t want them to go bankrupt. But then this starts seeping into other parts of the user interface, and at that point it becomes a problem. \n\nA good example: you know on the bottom of the For You section on Apple Music you have a perfectly organized and comprehensive list of new releases by artists you listen to? That’s very easy to do with all the data these services have on your listening habits, and yet Spotify doesn’t have a serviceable version of that. Why? Because they would rather have you listening to your Release Radar and Discover Weekly playlists — where they can push the music the labels paid for. \n\nThis is what actually pushed me squarely into Apple Music. Like OP, I was subscribed to both for a while, but now I’ve cancelled Spotify and I think it will stay like this for the foreseeable future.\n\nEDIT: Just remembered another example. Podcasts. Spotify has been pushing podcasts like crazy, and it’s indeed crazy to me. I like podcasts, but it’s, like, **a completely different thing**?! The only reason why Spotify wants to push podcasts into their main app is for their profit, not for the user experience. The app becomes bloated and fragmented. Meanwhile, on Apple, you have two separate apps — because that’s the better experience. \n\nWhen the way they make money is not synergistic to the user experience, Spotify always chooses the former. Would Apple choose the latter? Probably not, but the crux of the matter is: Apple doesn’t have to make this choice. The way they naturally make money is by offering great products that work well with each other. That’s synergistic.', ""I was on AM from the very start up until last December. I made the switch to Spotify and even though I dislike the UI, I'm unlikely to go back. \n\n* Spotify has superior playlists to AM. I'd say roughly half the time the AM Playlists would have garbage in them that was either unrelated to the Playlist at hand, weird versions of the songs, or just generally poor quality from a curation standpoint.\n\n* With Spotify, even if you cancel your service with them, your playlists still exist. All my Apple Music playlists that I spent so much time curating are gone. That is vastly annoying. Meanwhile there was a period where I had both Spotify and Apple Music and I opted to go with Apple Music over Spotify. A couple years later when I went back to Spotify, my Playlists are still there. I cannot say the same for Apple Music.\n* Voice Control from anything other than a HomePod or an iPhone. I can control Spotify by voice in my car, my phone, from my Echos, or from my Sonos. With AM, I'm limited to my car and my phone and half the time it would get the song wrong. \n\nI didn't find that the Album list was any better or worse between Spotify and AM. I didn't feel like I lost anything, though I will say that it was nice that I had local music on my phone from iTunes that AM would auto-complete the album for me. Overall, I think that AM had an easier to view UI than Spotify does, though I disliked that Apple kept making it harder to use with every update for features I liked. \n\nPlus my Wife likes it better which means I don't endure her complaining about shitty playlists on AM anymore. \n\nI don't have anything really against Apple Music, I just happen to like Spotify more."", ""The library is what I am missing most about AM. When Spotify introduced the new UI and that you click artist you follow it goes to artist page and not their saved songs really killed me. I live in a rural area so it never loads. So I'm forced to playlist and not listening by artist. I do have all liked songs downloaded but a lot of the times that will not even load."", '[deleted]', 'i feel like even for playlists the am interface is so much better\n\nthat last update really ruined spotify for me', 'Spotify wins in the multi platform category.

I love my music discovery and radio and collaborative playlists, so even though the UI annoys me to death, I still use Spotify.

I love being able to swap between various computers, my iPhone and my Android phablet and control the music coming out of the much-awaited Apple TV app. I pay for both, but 90% of my listening happens on Spotify. I don't find Apple's recommendations to be as good, even if the interface is nicer. Apple Music does let you add your own songs on a computer and listen to them from any device, regardless of whether they were originally on iTunes or not. This is something I've only seen on one other music service (Google Play) and I would love to see it come to Spotify. I think you can have local files that play from the desktop app, but they don't get uploaded anywhere."", 'I like Spotify’s UI more but Apple Music is better to use on Apple devices + has A LOT more K-Pop and J-Pop songs sooo', 'So for me, I first got on the Apple Music free trial for 3 months when it first came out. But I realized that I didn’t really know how to use it, and when it comes to technology and software, it’s pretty intuitive to me. I didn’t even know where iTunes stopped and Apple Music started. But 3 months went by and I think the first and only time I really used Apple Music was to listen to Drake and Future’s collab album. But I didn’t like the experience. \n\nCurrently, I’m trying to get into Apple Music again. There are several reasons why I want to leave Spotify - I had it free for one year due to a promo, but it just ended this month. I also just got the Apple Watch and I’ll like to be able to go to the gym without my phone. And in the country where I’m currently living, the monthly membership is equivalent to $3, versus the $10 that I’m now paying for Spotify. \nSo more than enough reasons. And still, I find myself just not using it and going back to Spotify. The experience getting it set up was so clunky! The app would freeze, playlists that I made on my Mac were showing up on my iPad but not on my phone until a day later, it just hasn’t been a good experience. \nI’m still trying, but the month’s free trial is running up and yet I find myself still confused by its user interface, while Spotify’s is just natural.', ""\nI didn't enjoy Apple Music at all.

Why does New Music Mix suck so badly?,"It's utterly awful and the main reason I keep Spotify around at this point (its Release Radar). I got today's new mix and literally 90% of the songs on it were by bands I've never even heard of. I happen to know, because I do my research, that 7 bands I listen to fairly regularly released new full-length albums today. Not one of them seems to be on the list.

Why is it so bad and is there any hope in sight for it to stop being shit?

Okay so just by way of concrete examples, here are a handful of the major releases out today by artists I've followed/added albums to my library by:

* Mayhem - *Daemon*
* Alcest - *Spiritual Instinct*
* Hour of Penance - *Misotheism*
* Sunn O))) - *Pyroclasts*
* Savage Master - *Myth, Magic and Steel*

Yes, it will try to recommend things you might like, but the fact is there are some weeks where nothing “good” has been released. It’s subjective, and also your willingness to listen to a particular piece of music may vary with your own mood on a given day.\n\nMy only suggestion is to keep training AM by loving tracks, adding tracks to playlists, and also disliking tracks that you don’t want to hear.

Questions about Apple Music on top of old curated iTunes (now Music) library and duplicates.,"Hello, 

I have been curating my iTunes music library since 2000, adding songs, albums, etc. to it, maintaining the meta-data and artwork, and so forth.

Then iTunes Match came along, which I enabled and then iCloud Music Library came along and then Apple Music came along.

Now my library consists of: Matched, Uploaded, Apple Music songs.

I usually listen to AM through custom radio stations and whatever I like, I add it to my library. The problem is that I might already have a non-AM version of that song or album.

&#x200B;

At some point I want to clean up one version of the song(s) or the other. Is there an obvious way to do that (ie with applescript) or an application?

I use macOS Catalina.

Cheers.","[""If you're not familiar with Dougs Scripts, I think they might have one that could help you out. Not sure if they've been updated for Catalina yet, as I've stayed on Mojave for the time being. \n\nhttps://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php\n\nThere's always the Show Duplicates section in Music (iTunes has it, hopefully still there in Music) that might help a bit too.\n\nHonestly I took the time to attempt to get a Match on most of my 5K-ish own content and managed to only have about 400ish 'unmatchable' songs.

[HELP] Managing the music queue with Play Next and Later,"Hi,

maybe this was discussed in the past. I've tried to search for it but without a proper answer.

Although I enjoy Apple Music I have one big but. That one is that the queue management doesn't make sense on the iOS. While using Music app on the MacOS is without a problem, the iOS has one big flaw. 

Let me paint you a picture:  
I'm listening to a random album (let's say I'm listening to Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson) and I decide to slide a different song by a different artist right behind the one I'm listening at the moment. I use play next function and it gets put in the queue. Great. Then I decide to add another song right behind the one I just chose before coming back to Melody Nelson. I use Play Later. That however puts the song waaaay at the end of the whole queue (including the whole album). If I'd use Play Next, it would play before the song I chose prior to the previous one. MacOS makes a difference between the Next/Later and Album queue, the iOS app does not. Why?

Thank you for your help/tips/etc...","[""This has been an issue on iOS for a few years now. Submit feedback and hope they change it I guess? I've given up on it for now..."", 'Technically makes sense. Play next= play after the current song.

I know that I can export them as .txt files, delete the playlist in Apple Music, and then import the .txt file again and all is well and good so long as I still have the mp3 file on my computer. HOWEVER, if I were to replace my mp3 file with a Apple Music equivalent, would the song still appear in my playlist once I imported it? Not sure what goes on under the hood, so I was curious if anybody had any insight into this. 

Thanks in advance!","['Maybe a silly solution, why combine the two? Have your offline music on a location in your pc or phone and use the streaming service as a find new music/listen to different stuff tool.', 'DON\'T DO THAT! I ended up doing the opposite- and hopefully you can still do it too: I had made a copy of my entire collection on an external drive and kept it so I\'d always have a virgin copy to revert back to from the day I also bit the bullet, and I\'m glad i did. \n\nHere\'s why: I painstakingly saved what you\'re calling ""the streaming versions"" of MY ENTIRE DAMN LIBRARY (\\~50k tracks). I then used iTunes Match (which i guess now is just called Match?) to be able to upload all my library tracks that weren\'t available for streaming. This was great, for like a week, and then I quickly realized that I was having ""streaming versions"" that were no longer available for streaming. It happens far more often than you think. It was driving me nuts, because they\'d come and go, or it\'d substitute the single in place of the album track I had saved. I couldn\'t handle it. I deleted my entire library, and plugged back in that virgin copy of my library and then used Match to match what it could. The good thing there, is I haven\'t found any missing songs since then- I believe it reverts back to my uploaded copy if licensing becomes an issue (maybe someone else can confirm this?). \n\nGodspeed.', 'This is what I did. I have 2 separate iTunes music libraries. One is a large library of all my ripped music. I call it joRipped. I have a second library of all Apple Music. It\'s called \uf8ffMusic. In my \uf8ffMusic library I have the prefs set to leave any music files dragged into my \uf8ffMusic library in place in my joRipped library & NOT copy them to \uf8ffMusic. If I find an artist that I may have more music than Apple has, and I\'d like to stream it,  I\'ll find the album in the joRipped library folder and drag it into iTunes with my \uf8ffMusic library open. This way my original high quality files stay in place, I don\'t add extra/dupe copies of music files in \uf8ffMusic and when iTunes updates my iCloud music library, it will upload those albums, my metadata & artwork & I can stream them from anywhere ... and my original high quality files & my joRipped library have nothing to do with Apple Music or my iCloud Music library (iCloud Music library is turned off in joRipped). And of course ... all my music & all other data is backed up to a separate local 6TB HD via TimeMachine.\n\nIf you ever do buy a new CD to rip, quit iTunes if it\'s open, the relaunch iTunes while holding down the Option key, you will be able to navigate to your ripped music library, open it & then rip the music in the format of your choice. To change back to your Apple Music library, quit iTunes, relaunch with option key down & choose your Apple Music Library. You only have to do this when adding new ripped music to your old library.\n\nThat\'s how I bridge both worlds & keep my sanity & my ripped files intact.\n\nIf your old music was handled by iTunes previously you\'re set. Just quit iTunes, relaunch iTunes with Option key down & create your new Apple Music (only) library. You don\'t have to keep both old and new libraries on the same HD either. The new library will be much smaller than your old music library.\n\nTry not to make the mistake of letting Apple Music ""find"" & ineptly ""match"" your ripped music that MIGHT be on Apple Music—that\'s where the horror show begins & you seem to be already experiencing some of that. You may very well need to rebuild playlists if you want the playlist to be only Apple Music & your music uploaded to your iCloud library. That may suck ... but if you\'re going to stay with Apple Music you may have to. One of the issues of trying to export playlists, the way that Apple has named a song/artist/album/genre may be different than your metadata—this is where it just gets ugly & you either get no match or a very bad match!\n\nAnd I\'m a meta data freak—Apple Music will give different genres to different songs in the same album by the same artist. So I\'m constantly changing Apple Music metadata to fit how I like see genres, or artist listings, etc. Also there will be times when Apple Music will show a completely different album cover for something I have the original of. First I\'ll add the album to my \uf8ffMusic library ... I\'ll hunt for the original via Google.If I find it I replace Apple artwork and if not ... I open my joRipped library & drag  the artwork to my desktop, reopen my \uf8ffMusic library, find the album I just added & give it the artwork it should have. Yeah ... I\'m anal retentive like that. lol But I make Apple Music work how I want—not how Apple THINKS I want it.\n\nHope that all makes sense & helps. Good luck in whatever you do! 🙂']",5,19.34732985034585,spotify

"[Library discussion] Trying to create 'Mood playlists', always falling back to Genres. Help me sort it out!","Hey guys. 

I'm trying to steer away from organizing my music in Genre based playlists, because genres are so blurred nowadays and so many songs can fit in so many genres. I read some old posts and people recommended to build Mood based playlists instead of genre - 'Happy' songs, 'Sad', 'Party', 'Traveling' etc. I  really like the idea and thought  giving it a try.


Now, here's the thing - I created these Mood playlists: Chilled, Rage, Happy.

there are songs that its very obvious where they fit (uplifting songs = Happy etc).

BUT, I realized I have tons of songs that I just like, and can't classify them as Chilled/Rage/Happy. 

Songs by Pink Floyd for example, or Radiohead - I just love to hear them, and they not necessarily related in my head for a certain mood. 

So, what now? this made me, again, go back and create a playlists called Rock :-(   back to square one!


How do you guys classify your Mood playlists? what do you do with those 'regular' songs you just like?


Thanks :-)","[""I try not to do moods, rather I do situations. These help me get songs across many genres that all have a similar vibe, which kind of end up being the mood.

Pre-Add Albums Not Working AGAIN,"So a little over a year ago I noticed that my album pre-adds were not working correctly. For example: if an unreleased album has two singles available, I hit the “add” button and the two available single download fine. However, when any future singles (or the entire album) becomes available the songs do not download like they’re supposed to. I don’t even receive any sort of notification letting me know a single or album I’ve pre-added has been released.

Instead, I need to search the album myself and when I click on the album I see all the songs that should have been added to my library automatically have the cloud download icon next to them. I can click the download cloud for each newly released song but it doesn’t work. The only way to get those songs in my library is to delete them and re-add them which defeats the entire purposes of pre-adding albums.

The quickest way is to simply delete the entire album and re-add the album AFTER the album is released but this is so annoying because it removes the songs that were previously released from any playlists.

I had this issue for months a year and a half ago consistently. Now I’ve had the issue again for months consistently. I’m seriously thinking about leaving Apple Music. The interface has always sucked but this is really pushing me to leave. I would be gone already if Spotify had some way to auto download all the songs in my Apple Music library to my Spotify library.

I can’t remember if I did something a year and a half ago to get this issue resolved (TEMPORARILY) but somehow this issue was resolved for me for a brief time—then it started happening again and now it happens every single album I pre-add.

Any pointers? Anyone else still experiencing this??

New user with problems with the desktop app,"I want to move from the possibly expiring Google Play Music to Apple Music like so many other refugees (I started a 3-month trial), and bear in mind I am extremely nitpicky when features are different, but some of the stuff I've encountered in just the past few hours using the macOS app are just ridiculous. Last night I used the mobile app on Android and it honestly seemed fine, other than two taps to love a song (very bad in the car, I don't have Android Auto) and even more awkward to have shuffle and repeat in the queue window. These are just the latest problems I have with the desktop app:

1. This has got to be a bug: playing songs on the album page (whether or not it's in my library) won't queue regardless of what the queue shows, it just stops after one song. Not 100% certain this always happens but it can be very confusing figuring out how and where an album, playlist, or queue is technically playing from. This should absolutely not matter, the only thing that matters is my queue.
2. Both on mobile and desktop it takes two clicks to love a song except in my song library
3. No playlist of loved songs (only sorted in song library) - miss this from GPM which I can't export using Stamp (so long, spare time)
4. Album library seems to only be sorted by artist and not the album name
5. You can't go to the artist or album by clicking on the song whether the banner or in a playlist
6. No play counts apparently EXCEPT if it is played in my song library

I hope my terminology makes sense; if it doesn't I'll link an imgur album and use visualizations. I'm currently using 10.15.1 (whatever the current public release of Catalina is) so maybe it really is that buggy since the Music app is brand new.

Is there a way to get a list of the albums/music files so I can transfer from iPhone to Macbook?

Linking to album in iTunes Store (not Apple Music),"I'm working on a website for a music artist and currently trying to embed links to purchase his latest release. It is an album on iTunes for purchase (not for streaming on Apple Music).

Apple Music/ITunes question,"This is kind of and odd and specific question, but hopefully someone can help me out.

1. Lets say there’s a specific song, we’ll call this “song X” and this song has accumulated 100 plays in your iTunes library.

3. So after you sync the devices you back up your MacBook to an external hard drive, meaning that Song X has 100 plays in the ITunes library on that particular back up. 

4. Now let’s say you play the song for a while on your iPhone, accumulating 50 more plays, making it 150 plays on your IPhone.

5. Typically, you would go back to your Mac and sync and both the Mac and iPhone would have song X at 150 plays. But let’s say in the time before this, you restored your Mac to a previous back up in which Song X only had 50 plays. So would would it add the total from the iPhone with the backup of 100 plays, making both 150? Or would it revert to the previous sync of 50 plays and add the newly accumulated 50 plays making it 100?","['Good question, but super specific.

# Playlist folders

I have come to absolutely love Apple's official Playlists. It seems like every playlist is updated frequently and has perfectly picked music. I save a lot of their official playlists for future listens, but now my playlist list is dauntingly large and somewhat annoying to browse through. I can make folders in iTunes on the computer for personal playlists. However I cannot add official Apple playlists to folders. Not only would I like to be able to add Apple Music Playlists to my own folders, I would like the ability to create these folders in iOS and iPadOS.

# Pinned Radio Stations/Shows

I love listening to Elton John's Rocket Hour but I find it incredibly annoying to have to dig for it in the radio tab every time I want to listen to it (yes, it might be under my recently played list, but usually it isn't because I listen to the show too sporadically). Also, someone recently mentioned the show Alligator Hour which looks awesome, but I don't really have time to start an episode now, so why isn't there any way for me to queue or save a radio show/episode for future play? 

Also, I have a personal radio station which plays me a perfect mix. But I have to start it by asking Siri. When I'm on a train, in public, the last thing I like doing is asking Siri for something. I just wish there was a place under the Radio tab where I could immediately start my personal radio station. 

# Love Button, Shuffle, Add Button on Now Playing Card

Please add these things back! The shuffle button is now microscopically small and it is only accessible through pressing another microscopically small button. Let's say I hear ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole for the first time, and I want to Love, Add, and then shuffle the playlist, here are the steps I would have to take from the Now Playing card: 

1. Tap the ""...""
2. Press ""Love""
3. Tap the ""...""
4. Press ""Add To Library""
5. Tap the Queue button 
6. Press the Shuffle button (usually this takes me a couple taps if I'm not absolutely precise because the button is so small)

6 steps for what used to take just 3 little taps on the Now Playing Card. With each update they simplify the Now Playing card to the point where it's not simple to do the most basic tasks.

# Crossfade

iTunes (Apple Music now) has it. Why isn't it available for iOS? This is a huge thing I miss about Spotify. It made music feel more like a radio show or a DJ is playing my tracks. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it sure would be nice.

# Continuous Play

Spotify, YouTube Music, probably every other streaming service has this feature. Is this Apple's small way of deterring people from listening to a lot of music (as to keep their profit as high as possible)? Again, this one isn't a deal-breaker.

Found a new feature: Empty Albums,"So I was browsing and I found this new feature. I'm hoping that's a bug? Can anyone confirm if they're seeing these albums as empty too? I can see tracks in other Albums so yes this is not a bug in my app. Only some albums are empty.

Why advantages are there for Apple Music versus Spotify?,"
Edit: What*. A perfectly good post ruined in the first word of the title smh


I’ve long doubled down on my usage of Apple Music as opposed to Spotify and other services. However, I only began to use Apple Music because it was compatible with my previously purchased iTunes library. I’m considering switching, I’m a data nut and love the stats that Spotify spits back as well as the playlists. Furthermore the UI seems more attractive to me. However, I’m almost certain there are some features I’ve not taken advantage of through Apple Music, and I was wondering what I might be missing should I switch? 

I’m most likely going to make a similar post on r/Spotify asking for the inverse, I just want perspective from both sides. Thank you in advance for your tutelage","['you can upload your own local music', 'Uploading your local music.\nMusic videos.\nApple Digital Master (no clippings on the compressed AAC audio file, dynamic range is preserved, sounds better than ripping from the CD, not all content on Apple Music is certified Apple Digital Master tho.)', 'Smart Playlists. And integration with Shortcuts app. So I can automate some stuff', 'It integrates better with Apple CarPlay and Watch.', 'The interface on Apple Music is far superior for actually managing a library, knowing what songs are on your device vs in your library vs not, and being able to easily remove these items. \n\nI deleted my entire mp3 library back in 2014 to switch to Spotify. At the time it was better than Apple options, but I noticed it completely changed my music listening habits. Suddenly, I was being less intentional about my music choices, and paying less attention to what I was listening to, lost in an endless playlist of curated “recommendations.” I’ve switched back and now I pay more attention to what I listen to because the interface makes sense, and reminds me more of the iPod I used to use to navigate my massive mp3 library.', 'If you prefer albums over individual songs, Apple Music’s UI will work better for you than Spotify’s, which is more focused on playlists and music discovery.', 'Sound is the biggest ...volume is louder with apple music', 'Bigger library, bigger download limit.', 'Upload your music b) better Siri and CarPlay support c) more traditional library', 'Well for one I believe Spotify premium can stream at a higher bit rate']",25,25.060304388483917,spotify

How do you organize your music? Do you add every album you ever wanted to your Library? Only albums you like right now?

There are probably about 20 full albums I have saved, but I save each album as it’s own playlist. I have all of those playlists in a playlist folder titled “albums”', 'I’m organized mostly through playlists. I have a main playlist that contains a little bit of everything, and it’s getting pretty close to 24 hours long now, but I also have a bunch of genre-specific playlists or decade-specific playlists. I listen to a lot of albums beginning to end and if I hear a song I like, I add it. Most songs I do download though just so I can keep my playlist offline, but I do it through the download all option.', 'Kinda seems like an old concept, but I just add what songs I like from artists. I aim for it to be full albums, so I don\'t just add the ""hits"". I usually tag with my preferred genres so I can browse my library with the way I see it. I\'ve tried multiple different organizing setups, but this seems to be the best natural way. I also make specific playlists for whatever occasion.', 'If I like a song I add it. What’s the point in adding entire albums if I specifically like one of the songs but not the others. That’s one of the big advantages of the subscription model. We don’t have to buy entire albums to get individual songs we like.', 'I like to add what I like cause then I like to use smart playlist from stuff in my library', 'I have like 6 different genres  playlists, then if I like a song I add it to an specific playlist and library where all my music is (about 2k) and then I create smart playlists for loved songs which are around 50 and are the newest ones I like listening to.', 'A little long, but I love the way my library is organized, so here goes. \n\nMy library is all my music going back to early days of ripping CDs and now mostly Apple music tracks. I\'ve also purged a lot over the years so it\'s at about 25k tracks. \n\nEvery song has a star rating (yes all 25,000 tracks). I started assigning star ratings the first day iTunes came out years ago while I was in college so I had the time. So all I\'ve ever had to do since then was continue with new albums. \n\nIf I add an album by an artist that I really like I\'ll usually do a blanket ""all 3 stars"" then adjust after listening but I only do that for albums I\'m going to listen to immediately after adding. Otherwise it gets no stars.\n\nI then have a smart playlist for all songs with no stars which is my backlog to go thru.\n\nEvery song with 3 or more stars is ""loved"". I then have smart playlists for only loved songs, as well as 4 and 5 star playlists. Also smart playlists that combine ""loved"" with genres and years, etc ..\n\nI also do mood and situational playlists as well, including ""best of"" for different genres and bands and also year end lists. \n\nSince I have younger kids my main playlist in the house that I play all the time is called ""kitchen"". It\'s a smart playlist of every ""loved"" song but excluding genres that contain the words ""metal"" ""rap"" ""hip-hop"". All my songs are genre tagged so by doing this that usually filters out all explicit lyrics and heavy metal. I will override as needed, for example I have all Metallica as Metal but I override several tracks as ""hard rock"" genre so that they appear in kitchen playlist.  Same with certain rap tracks without explicit lyrics such as Love Lockdown by Kanye for example. This list contains about 9,000 tracks.\n\nI do purges of 1 and 2 star songs over time if I haven\'t listened to them in years. This is all a lot of work but I enjoy it. I have a finished basement that\'s all mine with a music room. I\'ll go down there late night with my vice of choice and organize my library for a couple hours. \n\nLooking forward to sharing some of my lists here.']",9,25.125848370001272,spotify

"iCloud didn’t delete all my music, I did by accident/purpose","My dad created his Apple ID account when we got our first MacBook(2012).  After years and turning into an adult of my own, I created my own Apple ID for the separate messages and photo sharing options but continued to use his for everything else. I even pay for the Apple Music family plan on his Apple ID. Using two Apple Ids had some bumps as expected but nothing that made me regret it so far.  My iCloud account actually holds all of his music and vice versa. 

Fast forward to a week ago, my dads contacts and mine have merged, where I have all of his now and Siri thinks he’s me. So my plan was to split our accounts accordingly. I was trying to find a way to get my music library (his account) on to my own iCloud account. I tried using my computer to make a playlist of my whole library, 1083 songs (almost 3 days worth of music), and then just share it with myself through text messages or through airdrop. After making the playlist, I deleted all the songs from my library and that’s when it also deleted every song from the playlist.... 

I tried to copy the music at first and then send it to myself through iMessage but it didn’t work and that’s when I thought of a playlist. I didn’t expect that by deleting my library it would also delete that music from my playlist??  I haven’t found many useful links at how to restore my library as most searches suggest logging into original Apple ID and turning on iCloud music library but I’m the one who deleted my own music instead.

What stops me from using “Music” and how I got iTunes back on Catalina,"So, originally I was pretty hyped for the new Music application, hoping stuff like “for you” and “browse” would finally be more responsive.     But, since it’s a web based interface, they weren’t....       Also the Album-View just sucks. I don’t want a whole new window to open when I click on an album.   They way it folded down in iTunes was perfect. I could open and album and browse for other albums on the same page. The new interface just seems clumsy to me.
But the biggest drawback for me certainly is the lack of any remote control function.   The classic iTunes remote app doesn’t work with “Music”.     So I tried to get my old iTunes back.     I still hat the app laying around in my TimeMachine.  But just copying the app gives you an error.    So I found I script online which allows me to “reinstall” the iTunes i had already copied.   iTunes works like a charm (syncing, library, remote) the only buggy thing is that it prevents finder from accessing your iDevices (so you have to sync via iTunes) and when opening the app it always asks for permission for inbound network activity (guess it’s for the remote)

I found the install script on this page (just copy it in the “script” application and run it)

The next day it was using 80GB of RAM, which obviously bled into swap and was leaving me with 5GB of free hard disk space. Quitting the app was excruciatingly slow (because it had to delete all the swap stuff) - it took 15 minutes, force quitting it didn’t work. Once reopened, it kept “getting artwork” and it slowly started filling up RAM again - with no indication of how much work it had left.\n\nI’ve scouted the Apple forums, where many other people had the same problem and were proposing solutions. What worked for me was deleting the artwork folder from the old iTunes folder — apparently, Music was converting all the stuff there to a new format (plain jpg/png instead of the encoded  .its crap from before) in another folder in the Library, so deleting/moving the original folder stops that process... which apparently can’t ever be resumed even if you restore that folder to its original position. So now it stopped “getting artwork” and eating my RAM, but I have a few hundred albums without their artwork, even though if you inspect the songs or open them in the Finder they have an embedded artwork. These artworks have also disappeared from my phone, so who knows what the fuck is going on underneath.

iTunes gone?,"Hey guys. I am, and always have been, an avid iTunes user. I have Apple Music as well, but I barely use it. WHY? Because a lot of the music I listen to is not offered. I’m very compulsive with my music. I have a system. I listen to a lot of artists and I like to go through their discographies chronologically. I like to listen to everything an artist has released.

I’ll use The Felice Brothers as an example. The Felice Brothers are a folk band from New York. They have a pretty extensive discography. I have bought, file shared, or torrented all their music. In my iTunes, I have all their albums organized by album and year. For bonus tracks and singles, I download the audio file off of YouTube and organize them into my iTunes in respect to the album they belong to or year of release. Apple Music has maybe five or six Felice Brothers albums and maybe one or two EPs. They’re lacking a lot of material. I understand that I will still be able to import my files into Apple Music, but will they be arranged the way I arrange them in my iTunes? This is one example of many artists whose music is scarce on Apple Music.

Now the syncing issue. When I listen to music, I like to keep track of my play count. Once I listen to an album five times, I’ll give it a rating. When my music is listened to on my iPod and then synced back to my iTunes, the play count updates accordingly. Will my play count transfer to my Apple Music library once iTunes is gone? Cause so far I see no option to see play count in Apple Music. Will I have my personal star ratings? Play count is very important to me. My music listening history lies there. I love to see how often I have listened to an album, I love keeping track of that, I love the organizational aspects of iTunes, my ratings, my album art, my playlists...

Before I update my Mac to Catalina, I need proof, evidence, hard confirmation that all of these things will still be there when I make the move. Otherwise I’m going to leave my system as it is.

Sudden region blocking,"I have a song on my iphone (Doom and Gloom - The Rolling Stones) that, before I synced my music an hour ago, I could listen to. Now I'm trying to listen to it and it's telling me the song is not available in my region (Canada).

Others are done randomly, like I'll have a full album on and 1/3 of the songs are region block.

Can’t sync music onto my iPod.,"Recently, I decided to try Apple Music and start adding music that I've been meaning to put on my iPod for a while. But it has NOT been smooth sailing for me. Yesterday I made a post [asking whether I can edit info for songs/albums that are in my iCloud Music Library](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/dfyw05/how_do_i_edit_song_info_in_my_icloud_music_library/), and one person said that I should just empty my iPod Touch 6's music library and resync it with iTunes. So I went into iTunes, turned off ""Sync Music"", synced my iPod, rechecked it, and tried syncing it again. I can't sync my music back in! Everything seems to be on there, but they are now accompanied by the download icon required to be able to listen. The only exceptions are a couple of my more recent iTunes purchases and the four albums I've added with Apple Music.

I tried Google for an answer, and it says that I need to turn off iCloud Music Library. I don't wanna do this. I enjoy listening to my music wherever I go without Internet access being required, but I also wanna be able to add music to my iPod without having to buy any more iTunes Store cards, thus saving me a fortune. Is there any other workaround for this?

I think I have an idea: what if I turn off iCloud Music Library on my iPod, but NOT on my laptop? Then I can just download music within iTunes and then sync it like I've been doing for so long, only this time with Apple Music and not the iTunes Store. Will this work, or does it have to be enabled on *both* devices for my new music to be listenable?","[""I was the person that responded to you yesterday. I might not have been as detailed as I should have. \n\nSince your iCloud Music Library is on, on iTunes and that's the most accurate info that's perfect.

Help with new update - can't transfer music from my macbook to my iPod.,"I have a MacBook. I use it mainly to post on reddit and to manage my huge music collection.  I am not a tech savvy person - my wife had to twist my arm to get me to get an ipod and dump my huge space-occupying CD collection.

So a coupe days ago, I got a notification that some updates were ready. I finally got around to updating my computer yesterday. I didn't realize the entire OS was being replaced, including iTunes. If I had known that, I wouldn't have done it.

I've spent an insane amount of time organizing and adding custom artwork to my tracks. Only about half has shown up. There's a ""loading artwork"" message on the lower left, but it's been there overnight and no artwork has appeared since last night. I can't get it to go away, and I'm afraid to go in and replace the art in case it does finally load and updates over it and then I have to do it *again*.

I tried hooking up my iPod to transfer some music I downloaded yesterday. before the update, I had been doing manual transfers, just clicking on the albums I want to move to the iPod and moving them to iPod area on the left. This doesn't work now. I click on the album, move it to the iPod area on the left, and nothing happens. The music won't transfer. This has me angrier than anything else BECAUSE IT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT OF THIS SOFTWARE.

When I hooked my iPod up, iTunes immediately transferred about fifty copies of various playlists I have on my iTunes, multiple copies of each, and multiple copies of playlists that I had once had on my iTunes but deleted months ago. I ejected my iPod, and now I'm a little afraid to hook it back up.  Then I spent twenty minutes deleting all the playlists.

I want to go back to the previous version, which worked fairly well.  I'm realizing I probably not able to do that, at least not with my current level of tech aptitude.  Is there some trick to transferring music now that I'm not aware of?   Can I hook up my iPod without all the crazy playlists showing up again?

Why did they do this to me?  I just finally had everything exactly the way I wanted it.

Also, who to I complain to?","[""The 'missing artwork' seems to be a common thing in Catalina.

How do I edit song info in my iCloud Music Library?,"Yesterday, I made a post asking [whether I can edit genre names](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/dfhn4k/can_i_edit_genre_names/), and after reading the comments I thought ""OK, I think I'll finally give it a go"".

Items I previously purchased from the iTunes Store reverted back to their previous genre names, songs I added via CD's/MP3's that weren't on the iTunes Store now show completely different artwork rather that what I picked out for it in iTunes, and certain albums have been split making it very impractical if I am to listen to that album in its entirety.

Then, after couple of months of doing it, you'll be able to go back in time and listen to that first playlist, and connect to that familiar, fuzzy feeling you had in that specific moment of your life.

Apple Music library after a month of no subscription,"Hi All!

So, for years, I collected my music via iTunes on pc, listening it on my iPod, iPhone, and since I got a Mac, on that too. So as I thought I'm in the ecosystem, I should join Apple Music. it was awesome, every song from my pc's library been available too on every apple device.after this, my pc died, so every music I had was in the clouds. For two years of subscription, I simply saved my music via Apple Music, instead of getting the mp3 from other sources. Unfortunately I couldn't pay the fee for a month, and my subscription has been canceled, and my whole library disappeared, except those songs that I had the mp3 on my pc back then, and was downloaded either on my iPhone or MacBook. Today I repurchased it as soon as it was possible for me, but I got a message that my library couldn't been refreshed, so I quit, because I don't know if it tried to refresh the Apple Music library from the library with the 4000+ song to the new where I have only 20.

So my question is:

is there a way to safely get back my complete library, which I had until august, somehow?","['One option, go to your Music settings (in the Settings app) and make sure iCloud Music is turned on. \n\nIf that doesn\'t work try contacting Apple Support - chatting or calling them - they are always friendly and will try and help as best as they can. \n\nI will say that Apple does this stupidly ridiculous thing where after a month of not subscribing (and I\'ve heard up to three months sometimes) they trash your music library. So if you miss a payment and wait a month or more to re-subscribe there is a possibility that your music library won\'t be recoverable. \n\nThis sucks for someone like you, for soldiers who have to go away for extended periods of time, same with business people who travel abroad for extended time. Yes Apple, some people have legitimate reasons for ending their subscriptions temporarily - and it\'s absolutely childish to not offer a ""Pause Your Subscription"" option for these people.\n\nWhat\'s crazy is that Apple actually does save some information after you unsubscribe - your likes and dislikes - but they don\'t save the contents of your library. I quit Apple Music a few years ago because I became sick of their awful radio and recommendations, after a year of not using the service I came back because other services didn\'t suit my needs. Upon coming back to AM, none of my library was there (wasn\'t expecting it to be) but I was getting recommendations from bands I was listening to a year prior when I had the service (thus they do save some information).\n\nThe reason Apple trashes your library after a month+ of not subscribing? The looming threat of your library vanishing basically forces users to always be subscribed - thus you\'ll likely never try other streaming services. The downside to this tactic is that someone like you (whose library may be gone forever) will likely switch to a streaming service that doesn\'t trash your music in case you can\'t pay for a month or you have to cancel the service for a short while for other reasons. \n\nThis tactic makes Apple look so unconfident in their own product. It\'s like they don\'t trust that if people try Spotify for a month they will never come back to Apple Music. Whereas if Apple spent more time improving their radio/recommendations they wouldn\'t need to threaten to destroy music libraries because no one would have any reason to move to Spotify at that point anyways. \n\nSorry for the rant.

Can I edit genre names?,"I learned earlier this year - much to my dismay - that Apple was finally gonna kill off iTunes to shift focus to Apple Music. At first I was furious; I am far too accustomed to buying and listening to music on my iPod the old fashioned way. But then I took a closer look, and turns out it doesn’t mean they were gonna shut down the iTunes Store, nor were they gonna take away all the stuff I purchased over the years. They were just gonna move that stuff over to Apple Music. So I decided *maybe* I’ll give their subscription service a try. And as much as it’s gonna kill me inside to have to pay every month for it, when it comes to tracking down the songs/albums I wanna have it could save me a fortune. Haven’t gotten around to it yet, but I am thinking about it.

There’s just one catch, though. Whenever I buy songs from iTunes on my laptop, I usually modify the name of the genre to organize my music a little more neatly before syncing it to my iPod. For example, if I bought a song or album from a-Ha or Tears for Fears, I would change the genre name from “Pop” to “New Wave”. Or if I bought a song or album from Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd, I would change it from “Rock” to “Classic Rock”. I would name more examples based on my tastes, but I think you get the idea.

Can I still do this with Apple Music? And if so, can I do it from my iPod/iPhone or my laptop?","[""Yes you can. Your genres can be organized how you'd like.

"Apple Music on Catalina, a distaster","Since I updated my macOS to Catalina, iTunes is gone and it's only Apple Music, which is a good thing. Many parts of it had become irrelevant, so now it's more clear what is what. But man, what were they thinking before releasing this?

\- When I change metadata of a song, it is loading 15-20 seconds. Before it also took long, like 10 seconds, but it has almost been doubled now.

\- I can't press the + button anymore when I'm adding new songs to my library. It doesn't do anything except loading. I have to click on the menu and then click on 'add to library' until something is happening

\- Not all album artworks are squares, but Apple Music has made them all squares, which fucks up a small portion of my library

\- When I change metadata while I have an album opened, it doesn't change with it. So when for instance I change ""Pet Sounds (2019 remaster)"" to ""Pet Sounds"", it keeps stuck on ""Pet Sounds (2019 remaster)"" but there's nothing in it. To go back to the right album, I have to search again which takes me like 20 seconds extra.

\- The search function has become worse then it was

\- Sometimes songs don't play when I double click on the title. I have to wait until the play triangle appears, click on it, and then it plays

\- Sometimes it just starts loading, when I changed nothing at all. For like 10 seconds.

\- They still haven't fixed the fact that you can't search for <artist + title> only by artist or by title. Not both.

\- They still haven't fixed that some tracks have multiple genres.

\- They still haven't fixed a proper way to display featured artist. Spotify is the only app who does this in a good way.

\- I had a collection of music videos, but since not every music video is on Apple Music I added like half of it myself. These are all gone now. I can find them in the Apple TV app, but there's no possibility to return them to Apple Music.

\- Overall it has become a very very slow app. The main reason I use Apple Music is because I can edit metadata and create an ordered and big library. Spotify is super fast. When searching for a song I immediately have it. I really feel bad about the fact that Apple Music becomes worse with every update, because I love its functions so much. The filtered playlists, the countless options on adding and editing metadata.

Does Anyone on here use both Apple Music and Spotify?,"For the past month and a half, I've been super torn trying to pick between the two services, so I've decided I am just going to use both. My reasoning for using both is that I love a lot of things about both services. 

&#x200B;

Spotify's music discovery and playlists are great. I have discovered so much new music and artists via their playlists and personal playlists such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar. But I don't really like their UI and library management, plus no lyrics, and that's where Apple Music shines for me. It seems like every update, Spotify removes features and never adds anything. Like, Spotify used to have lyrics for example and removed them 3 years ago, promising they'd return shortly but never have.

Spotify has just left a bad taste in my mouth in terms of their insistence to remove features and make their UI worse with each update.

&#x200B;

Apple Music's UI is so clean and organized and Apple respects your music as your personal music library. There's no 10,000 song limit, there's music videos/genres, amazing lyrics feature, light and dark mode, ability to upload your own music, etc. If Apple Music had comparable playlists and discovery features, then Apple Music would be 100% a winner for me.

So what I do is I use Spotify to discover music and browse their playlists, then I transfer these playlists and all of the new music I discover on there over to Apple Music via SongShift, which has always worked wonderfully for me.

Also, Spotify works with all of my google homes, Apple Music of course does not. For this reason alone, I will be keeping Spotify. \n\nHOWEVER, I mostly prefer the more robust user interface of Apple Music, the fact that it’s so well ￼ integrated into my iPhone, but most importantly (to me) it works in my car. (I don’t have CarPlay, but I can browse my AM library through the interface of my car, which is not possible through Spotify) I can sort by playlist/song/artist etc, and control it all on the vehicle touch screen. This is huge for me. \n\nWhen I hear a new song I like on Spotify, I Shazam it so it auto adds to my AM library. (It adds to the “My Shazam Tracks” playlist, which automatically downloads and adds it my AM library) This is also a very slick feature I literally use on a daily/weekly basis.  \n\nFor the reasons listed above, I see enough value in keeping both services for the foreseeable future.

Uploaded/Matched tracks turned into AM DRM protected tracks at some point,"About half of my library at some point turned into AM DRMed protected (m4p's). The majority of these tracks were indeed my music that I ripped long ago or loaded myself.

History and theory: We added iTunes Match and loaded up our library. At some point after that (few years ago), I completely removed (not deleted) all the tracks and re-downloaded everything to get 256 kbps. I do not know if this was the point that half the library's tracks turned into protected tracks or if it happened later. When AM was released, I signed up for that and cancelled iTunes Match.

I can clearly see in my iTunes folder in Finder that half my tracks are in the ""Apple Music"" folder and the rest are in ""Music"". Many albums are broken in parts where some tracks are protected and some are not.

Has anyone heard of this before or experienced it? Since this happened many years ago, I do not have a full backup of my library, so I'm assuming I am SOL here.","['In the early days of AM, it had its own matching technology. After finding a match a track’s iCloud status became “Apple Music”. Redownloading matched tracks at the time meant you ended up with the same versions as the AM service had, and that meant DRM’ed music. After a while (and loads of complaints)AM changed the matching technique to the same one present in the Match service. So redownloading tracks from that moment meant downloading DRM-free content. This worked immediately for first time AM users, but for AM- users who had already matched  with old AM-match there wasn’t an immediate and transparent move to new Match-Match. I wouldn’t be surprised if it never moved to new match in some scenarios. I hope this kind of explains what happened to your music.

[Discussion] I think the iOS 13 update made some simple functions worse. Let me explain why!,"Let's say you are listening to a new song and you want to add it to your library. Before the update you had a ""+"" button on the lower left corner and it couldn't get easier than that. Now on the lower left corner you have the ""lyrics"" button that I think is a way less useful than the ""add to library"" button. 

Worst thing is that on the opposite side you have another button but it is to see the queue, I suppose that button makes more sense but I find it annoying that when you pull down the ""queue"" button to hide it and continue browsing, after that, if you press the ""now playing"" song, it opens the ""queue"" again. 

Now the ""options"" button: In my opinion the button it is placed in a weird spot and the icon doesn't catch my attention enough to remember to touch it instead of the ""queue"" button. Everytime I want to add a song to my library I press the queue button because I forget that actions is at the ""..."" button.

Now, the last but not least of my complainings is: Why do they moved the ""Shuffle"" and ""Repeat"" buttons. I didn't notice how well they were implemented until they changed it. I know that before the update they were part of the queue too but you just had to pull up the queue to press ""Shuffle"" or ""Repeat"", now you have to touch two times on different parts of the screen to turn on or off those little icons.

What I think is a good idea but needs better implementation was the possibility to rearrange the actions in the options menu. I guess it was an opportunity from Apple to say: ""hey, these are the options, place them how you want so we are not responsible for ruining that too"".

I suppose Apple made those changes maybe to attract new users, but for someone really used to the functionality AM already had, this feel like a step-back. I hope they return to what they were well known for: good UI.

TL;DR: add to library button, shuffle and repeat are not easy to reach as they used to and the new queue is annoying.","['I highly agree', 'The add to library doesn’t bother me personally, but I agree on the shuffle/repeat and queue part, I much preferred the old way.

AirPlay v1 devices with Catalina Apple Music [Question],"Hello,

Does anyone know if Apple has dropped any AirPlay functionality from the new Catalina Apple Music? Specifically, I have a AV Receiver (Yamaha RX-A1070), speakers (WX-010), some old AirPort base stations hooked up to old bookshelf sound systems, and a few AppleTVs that I use iTunes to play synchronized music through my apartment. These are mostly AirPlay v1 devices, will I need to upgrade my hardware if I want to continue to have all my rooms playing audio in sync? Thanks!","[""Yo, did you ever find the answer/ do the upgrade? Been reluctant to upgrade because I don't want to screw with this amazing setup.""]",3,33.2485682790754,spotify

I chose Apple Music instead of Spotify today and here's why," I've  had Spotify since 2016 and been using it up until today when I've found  out that a beta version of Apple Music web player is out.

Now,  Spotify offers a great service and the key factor for me is that you  can play it on different devices and use your iPhone as a remote control  for it if you play Spotify through a Mac or a PC.

Also, most of the people I know use Spotify, so seeing what they are listening to is fun and it helps to find new songs.

The search on Spotify, when you write and the results appear instantly is really good, hard to beat that.

BUT!

Apple  is not a conventional company that would go along with the crowd, and I  am talking from a long-term business model perspective. Let me explain -  Apple does not offer a free Apple Music tier; iOS, macOS, watchOS and  everything else is not open source; the phones and computers do not  offer such  customization level as Android or PC might (although it  depends from where you look at it); and the list could go on, but the  basic idea here is that Apple understands the basic model of how America  works and on what foundation was it built on - **there is a price for everything**.

Spotify  does earn money from ads, but most of the money comes from Premium  users and most of the users in free tier are from Europe, while the U.S.  market chose Apple Music, because paying money for a quality service  means that the artists and the developers of the service will continue  making the service even better and artists will continue making great  music. And also, I can still use Spotify for free, while paying my share  to the great people behind Apple and the whole ecosystem.

The  fact that we, Apple users, trust Apple with our privacy, with their  decisions on how the operating system should look like, feel like, what  services are being offered to us and how much the continuity across the  devices brings us joy - that is why we love this company and I do  believe that in the future, in the long run, in the infinite game Apple  will crush everyone.

**tl;dr - The web player of Apple Music helped me to switch; In the long term I think Apple's services will boom.**

P.S.: not a native English speaker, I do apologize for my mistakes.  
P.P.S.: if this does not make any sense, I understand. My mind is racing a little bit.","["">and how much the continuity across the devices brings us joy\n\nAs an Apple Music subscriber I just want to point out the jarring lack of continuity within Apple Music itself. I wish I could go from listening to a song on my iPhone to listening to the same song on my MacBook. Given the leaps and bounds Apple has taken with continuity in pretty much everywhere else in the Apple ecosystem it is crazy to me that they haven't adopted Spotify's continuity for music. \n\nWhile a small part of of me would love to see Apple crush the competition, the majority of me knows that competition is the only way Apple Music will continue to evolve and grow. Apple Music suits my needs, but I still have a lot of gripes about it. There are features that Spotify has that I would love to see on Apple Music:\n\n1. Crossfade\n2. Continuous play\n3. Continuity\n4. Better Recommendations \n5. Daily Mixes\n6. A customizable radio feature (like Spotify's new and awesome radio app)\n\nI am now ardently locked down into Apple Music, so I doubt I will ever switch to another streaming service again. But there is much that Apple needs to add onto their own service. \n\nLike why is crossfade available for iTunes but not the iOS music app? Why does my Pages app have a pointless continuity feature but Apple Music doesn't? Why is there a dedicated radio button in Apple Music but there is no customization (such as making a radio station out of 2 or more songs/bands/albums). \n\nApple Music has only made improvements to their service (outside of the horrendous Now Playing card which gets worse with each update). Their recommendations have been slowly getting better. Dark Mode was #1 on my wish list. Their curated playlists are *phenomenal*. However, they have a long way to go, and I hope that the competition from Spotify will only help Apple improve their own stuff. \n\nI think that Spotify has such a dedicated fan base that Spotify will always be around. Apple Music works great within the Apple Ecosystem, but Android is the most popular operating system in the world right now, and Apple Music doesn't have the same ecosystem benefits on Android as it does on iOS/TVOS/MacOS/WatchOS...so this will always be a hindrance for Apple."", 'I think you’re right. Apple Music has actually overpassed Spotify in the US I’d I’m not mistaken.', 'We’re glad to have you on board. \n\nI personally chose Apple Music over Spotify because you can still customize things in Apple Music unlike in Spotify. \n\nYou want to add the exact correct genre?

You can change that.', 'The only reason keeping me from switching to Apple Music is that my Spotify subscription comes with Hulu & Showtime. Can’t pass up on that.', 'Enjoyed reading, thanks for sharing.\nI do agree with your points, though in general we always need to remember that competition is first and foremost important to us as consumers. If Apple will destroy everyone else as you suggest, we might suffer from it as well, in a form of price raises, lack of motivation to develop etc. So, giving your money to competitors is always a healthy idea!', 'Apple Music also pays artists way more. Doesn’t affect the users, but it’s good for creators. Also it’s incredibly easy to upload music there, as compared to Spotify', 'As far as I\'m concerned, a music service that lacks the ability to accept uploads of your own tracks is unusable. (And no, Spotify\'s crappy ""Local Files"" device sync doesn\'t cut it)\n\nSo it\'s pretty much Apple Music and Google Play Music, and Google is abandoning the latter to push YouTube Music (despite that service\'s complete lack of features), soooo... Apple Music, here I am.', 'i wanted to cause i get apple music for free with my verizon plan, but it is unusable on my galaxy s10 plus sadly, it worked fine the first couple days than it will not even let me open the app it kept crashing everytime i open it, i am back on spotify sadly, i miss apple music only thing i miss about apple lol', 'One of the main reasons I stick with AM, aside from pure convenience– I’ve used it continuously since 2015–is the fact that AM actually has editors working for it–professional music journalists/critics who spend a great deal of time crafting introductions for albums and playlists. Not to mention the detailed biographies you find at the bottom of most artists’ pages. Not every artist, but for the majority, at least. \n\nI really have come to value all this quality music writing. I don’t always agree with what they say, but that’s to be expected. It’s the thought and effort that counts, not to mention the consistently high quality of the writing itself. \n\nThe last time I used Spotify for any length of time was more than a year ago, but I never saw anything like this on their service. It’s got all the same music and perhaps its algorithms for suggesting new music tailored to your tastes are superior, but that’s not enough for me.', 'I switched this year from Spotify to Apple Music also.  My reasons were mostly due to AM being one of the last places that has a music locker.  I have a lot of tracks on various CD\'s that are not in publication or not ""popular"" enough to gain a place on any streaming service yet I still enjoy them.  Spotify does not easily provide a means of doing that, and I guess never will since they seem more geared lately to force-feed you content rather than compile your own mix.', 'Damn you just drank all the Apple kool-aid huh lol. I have an iPhone, MacBook, and Apple Watch and just switched over to Apple Music but I miss Spotify. I only switched because it’s included in my Verizon plan for free.

So I need to buy it to be able to add to my library which is a dollar price.\n\nSo, I think Apple Music more pricey than Spotify.\n\nIf you stream Apple music with iTunes, you will need more bandwidth than Spotify.

Removing tracks from library without removing them from playlists.,"I'm a Spotify refugee and switched to Apple Music mainly for the better library management. I'm enjoying the experience so far, but there is one thing that really bugs me.

It's the fact that deleting a song in your library also deletes it in all your playlists.

I like to keep full length albums in my library but add singles & individual tracks to a playlist. I moved my whole library from Spotify and I'd like to clean it, but I'm struggling to find an easy way.

[This Apple Support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206183) says:

>If you have songs in your Library that you want to move to a playlist and remove from iCloud Music Library, you first need to [delete the song from your library](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201323), which will remove it from all playlists. Then, add the song back from the Apple Music catalog and add it just to a playlist.

 This method is very time consuming and got me wondering if there is an easier way. I'm open to any suggestions.

TL;DR: How to move a lot of individual tracks from my library to a separate playlist (without removing them from the playlists when I delete them from my library)?","[""Right now, unfortunately, it can't be done.

How is it possible that after all these years “For You” and “Create Station” are still so bad?,"How is it possible that after all these years “For You” and “Create Station” are still so bad?

I think I signed up for Apple Music like on day one to take advantage of being able to talk to Siri to play music and the Apple Watch to control playing music. 

I’ve been marking music “Loved” and  whatever Apple now calls disliking a song forever now. 

I’ve been wondering for a while how is it possible that after all this time “For You” playlists are so bad with Chill Mix in particular being a mix of suicidal songs and oldies 

Today I tried to Create a Station from an upbeat slow tempo song most would call “Chill” and the songs that played as part of the “station” were horrible. 

I remember Pandora, Last.FM, Spotify, you’d pick a song and start a station and it would be a pretty good mix of songs I’d like. 

It doesn’t even seem like it should be so hard to group genre, artist, year, tempo, mood to make a playlist people would like.

Could anyone who moved from Spotify (particularly after that awful UI update in the summer) give me a rundown on what they like more/less after the change? Thanks,"Planning on changing to AM in January after I get my Wrapped stats because I’m sick of Spotify’s shit, would like to know what others have to say to prepare for the switch, thanks in advance","[""Cutting and pasting a recent response I made to a similar question. Will preface this by saying that Spotify is phenomenal at algorithms and recommending songs. I really miss that about the service now that I'm on AM. However, they have completely lost me on their recent Podcast push, their recent UI overhaul, their pathetic 10,000 song library limit, and their awful library management (*that some people think is an improvement - but it's really a way to hold a users hand to not make a large library (which should be up to the user: a streaming company shouldn't force you to not add a lot of albums to your library - great freedom there Spotify /s*). I'm glad that Spotify exists because it pushes other services to improve their own features - and a lot of people really like Spotify (which is awesome because everyone is different and has different needs). I have found that Apple Music, even with some disadvantage, is by far the best music service for me. Anyways, here is my copied post:\n\n\\[i have used Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music extensively over the last year. Dabbled a little in Deezer and Pandora). Currently fully onboard with Apple Music.\n\nPros of Apple Music:\n\n* 100,000 song library limit\n* Apple ecosystem (controlling my AirPods via Apple Watch, uploading bootleg albums from my MacBook that can be played on all my devices, Apple TV playing high quality music videos during a get together, etc)\n* curated playlists. Apple has knocked it out of the park lately with their official playlists - chill, ambient, classical, basically any official Apple playlist is constantly updated giving you so much variety...the playlists seem genuinely put together.\n* I can upload pretty much any amount of my own music - bootleg tracks, local band tracks that aren’t available via streaming - and once uploaded I can stream them from any device I own.\n* Apple Music Browser player. This is something other services have had for years and years. But Apple finally got on board recently and the web player is by far the nicest I’ve used (in my opinion).\n* Metadata editing. This is a huge one for me. I can edit lyrics, edit what is and isn’t part of a compilation. I can change the annoying “Various Artist” label to whatever artist I want. I can even change album artwork (and I do this often, especially for albums I upload myself).\n* Elton John’s rocket hour. Beats 1 has some good radio shows, I wish Beats 1 would branch out some Beats 2 and Beats 3 so we could get more dedicated stations (Beats 1 is primarily top-40 and usually rap/pop). I would love to see a couple other stations start that are strictly dedicated to alternative, country, classical.\n* Apple’s official radio stations are awesome. If you make a station based off of a song or artist the results are hit or miss. But the official stations found under the Radio tab are always spot on for me.\n* the overall UI is my favorite of any streaming service I’ve used. The library system is perfect for people who like collecting albums. If you are a playlist person you have a section for those - (however there is still no way to sort or customize how your playlists are shown). Each genre has an extensive page of playlists, albums, and artists that is updated frequently.\n* searching by lyrics works super well.\n* the new lyrics feature is something I have actually been enjoying thoroughly. Lyrics scroll along as you listen - for me it works for most songs that have lyrics.\n\nCons:\n\n* Spotify has better algorithms for radio and personal playlists. But it isn’t as noticeable to me these days. All of the pros listed above easily outweighs this.\n* the Now Playing card seems to get dumbed down more and more with each update. Gone are the days where you “heart” or add a song directly from the card. Now you either have to 3Dtouch on the minimized card, or you have to press a tiny button to take you to a list of options where you can choose to add or like a song. Same with the shuffle button. It is just needlessly complicated now, ironically for the sake of simplicity.\n* no continuity. For a company that lauds how seamless their products are they sure are ignoring the glaringly obvious omission of handoff to other devices. If I’m listening to YMCA on my phone and start using my MacBook, is it so much to ask that I can easily\n\nAnywho, that’s my take. For my needs, I see that Apple Music has the technological edge in most areas. But for others I can see other services having a technical edge. It just depends on what you want and are happy with as a customer. If you like listening to music as a radio/playlist then you should definitely go with Spotify. If you like library management and a huge library, Apple Music is perfect. If you like music videos, ad-free YouTube, then YouTube Music is what you should choose. Best of luck! It can be hard committing to a service, but if you find something you really like you should absolutely stick with that."", 'I haven’t use Spotify in a very long tome so I don’t know any more. One think I like I save $20 if I pay once a year for Apple Music. Over paying $9.99 a month. Plus I rather just pay once and forget about the bill for a year. \n\nI less you are a student or something and get even better deal', 'Folks keep complaining about it but to be honest, I noticed absolutely no difference in the UI...\n\nI guess it’s just the way I use it but, no clue what the fuss was about.\n\nI search for a type of playlist, sample a few songs and follow it if I like it.

I also love the Siri integration, specially when I’m driving, but I think Spotify has that too now.\n\nThe only huge thing I miss is being able to block an artist, but I regained smart playlists so that’s a good trade.']",14,35.24797800154046,spotify

Live Lyrics not available for songs in my library,"Hi everyone,

I recently switched (back) to AM after years on Spotify. Actually I’ll use both services in the future but I’ll keep AM as my main library and Spotify for discovering new songs.

With iOS 13, a new functionality has been introduced: live lyrics. I’m really liking this feature but disappointed it doesn’t work as intended. 

The problem is that the lyrics are available for a song you searched for via the search function (set to “Apple Music”) but when you listen to the same song from your library, the live lyrics option is greyed out.

Is that normal?","[""To illustrate my point, here is a screen capture I've just done: [https://streamable.com/aldnr](https://streamable.com/aldnr)\n\nYou can notice I first pick a song my library: live lyrics are unavailable.

The three red stripes next to it mean that **this is the same song playing**, I just grab it from the search function in the main catalog instead. Again, no live lyrics. **But**, when I click on it, the song restarts and only at this time, live lyrics are available.\n\nI have to mention that this song comes my personal library (a CD rip) so this is a high quality file (.m4a, Apple Lossless codec) which has been matched with the AAC version of the AM catalog (it has even been deleted locally from my device as you can see with the cloud icon next to the song).\n\nIsn't iCloud Match supposed to transfer the lyrics as well?"", '[deleted]', 'I think it’s normal for now.

On a personalized radio how to tell Siri to play a song next without leaving that radio.,"Hello friends

I have a HomePod and I use Siri enough to play music. But I have a problem, if I tell you to play music of some genre or artist, it creates a radio based on my request. Until there it is fine, however if I want to tell you to put a song next, it does it but it takes me out of the radio I had created before. That is very cumbersome.

How do I just put the song I'm asking and continue with the radio that I believe.

99% of my music is gone,"I’ll start with the TL;DR,  I’ve just noticed that nearly all my music is gone from iTunes/Apple Music, tracks that I imported from my own personal CD collection and I’d like to know how to access it again. 

This might be a long post but I’ll hope it makes sense. 

I have used iTunes forever but never subscribed to Apple Music, using Spotify instead. I had a few playlists that I made on iTunes, with songs that I had imported from CDs over the last 15 years or so. I had also imported these playlists to Spotify. 

A little while ago tried to play one of these playlists on Spotify and noticed that all the tracks were gone and I said something along the lines of “let’s find some songs for your playlist”. Frustrated and curious, I opened up Apple Music and noticed that the original playlist was all gone except for 2 or 3 songs which I had downloaded (paid for) through iTunes. 

Also, my library has almost been completely obliterated of all my old music (including all the other playlists) and only the downloads remain. 

My question is, where the fuck is my music?? 

I paid good money and spent hours importing these CDs over the years. Do I need to pay for the subscription to Apple Music in order to have access to my own music again? 

Cheers.","[""I'm on the same boat, dude. Wish I had a solution for us both. Best of luck.""]",1,40.196079854316736,spotify

iPod (classic) shuffle Vs. iOS shuffle.,"TL;DR: started using my iPod classic again. It seems like the iPods shuffle- algorithm is better than iOS’s In my opinion. I get less back to back songs from the same artist/ same album on the iPods shuffle, than my iPhone’s. Since the launch of Apple Music, did Apple change the iOS shuffle algorithm? 



My Current library has 1902 songs. All from cds and direct downloads. No actual Apple Music streams. My iPhone and iPod has the same music library synced to them. 

Past few weeks I’ve been listening to my 6.5 gen iPod classic again. Either because the iPod is basically a single purpose device, unlike iOS devices. But It seems like I’m enjoying my music on shuffle more on my iPod, than I do on iPhone. 

We all have that song(s) that always come on with shuffle that we always skip, but on my iPod it seems like it happens less often than my iPhone. I always get the same ~250 songs I go though with slight variation to the mix on iOS. Like  on my iPod I’ve had times thinking “𝘥𝘢𝘮𝘯 𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘯’𝘵 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯 𝘮𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘩𝘴”. 

I  never just start same current shuffle queue when I listen to music. I always start a new shuffle queue at the beginning of a listening session. I know if I didn’t restart the queue on my iPhone then I wouldn’t notice this. But most of you know iOS doesn’t always remember the queue. 


What do y’all think about the iPods shuffle algorithm vs. iOS’s?",['They don’t really shuffle song to song as much as they jump around the list in batches now￼.

A Very Negative Experience With Apple Music,"Hi all. I wanted to share an incredibly negative experience I am having with Apple and possibly entertain some advice on any avenues of action I might be able to take. 

Story goes:

I had to get a new debit card, and I was trying to update my billing info in my Apple Music app. The app asked for 2 Factor authentication using a phone number ending in 03. I've never had a phone number ending in 03 in my life, so it seemed as though my account may have been compromised. 

I called customer service to try to get access to my account back. Apparently, there is literally no way for me to get access to my account without access to this phone number. I explained that this phone number was clearly either non-existent or in somebody else's possession, but they said there was no other way to verify my identity. I didn't believe them, so I spent nearly an hour on the phone with managers, technical support, etc. It just seemed so archaic and non-sensical that a phone number would be the only possible way to verify an account.

Well, it turns out that it is exactly that non-sensical over at Apple. There's literally nothing they are either able or willing to do. 

So, once I had accepted that the account was gone forever, I asked for my purchased music as a download, and I would just make a new account. They said without access to the account that I could not access that music. 

This was where I became very upset. It seems as though Apple is holding my property against my will. I told them there were 2 outcomes that would be acceptable to me:  
1) Provide me with downloadable links to all my purchased music.  
2) Issue me a full refund for all my purchased music.   
They said neither was possible. I pleaded, I chastised them, I tried everything, but they wouldn't budge.   
Now I feel as though I shouldn't roll over and let them keep my property against my will. I sent their legal department an email requesting either my property or a refund within 72 hours time. If I don't receive either, I currently plan to file a small claims suit against them. I have plenty of PTO left this year, and its a matter of principle for me now.   


Is there anything else I can do?","[""Why didn't you have 2FA already enabled on your account? If you didn't take the necessary precautions to secure your account, then the blame starts with you."", 'It’s not your property. You bought a license to the music not the actual music like if you were to buy physical media. Apple is within their rights to rescind that license at their discretion. It’s in the TOS you and everyone else who uses iTunes agreed to.  You lose access to your account you lose the music licenses associated with it\n\nEdit: this is the case with anything “purchased” digitally', 'It’s not your property though. Read the TOS. You pay to have access to it. Say the artist took all their music off Apple. You too would lose the music. At least that’s been my experience. \n\nApple Music sound quality is horrible anyway.

Android app no longer compatible with tablets [?],"So I went to update my app today, and I'm probably the only human being in the world to use Apple music in an android tablet, since I haven't seen no one complain abaout this, but Play Store simply says that it wasn't possible to install the app, and that's that. Was there any sort of announcement by Apple (of course not, why do even bother)? I think it's because of the many changes on the interface... maybe (hopefully) they'll fix it later

On my desktop in iTunes I have a large music library that I own outright. I've had these songs for years.
